<TITLE><PERSON>Desi Arnaz</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>Desi Arnaz</PERSON> (born <PERSON>Desiderio Alberto Arnaz</PERSON> y de Acha III) (March 2, 1917 December 2, 1986) was a Cuban American musician, actor and television producer.

<PERSON>Desi Arnaz</PERSON> was born on March 2, 1917 in <LOCATION>Santiago de Cuba</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Desiderio Alberto Arnaz</PERSON> (1894-1973) and <PERSON>Dolores</PERSON> de Acha (1896-1988). His father was <LOCATION>Santiago</LOCATION>'s youngest mayor and then served in the Cuban House of Representatives. The 1933 revolution, led by <PERSON>Fulgencio Batista</PERSON>, overthrew the American-backed President <PERSON>Gerardo Machado</PERSON>, landed his father in jail for six months, and stripped his family of its wealth and power. <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON>'s father was released when <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials, who believed him to be neutral during the revolt, intervened on his behalf. <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> and his parents then fled to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>.

In 1939, he starred on Broadway in the successful musical Too Many Girls. He then went to <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> to appear in the 1940 movie version at RKO, which starred actress, comedienne, and his future wife <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>. At the time, he also played guitar for <PERSON>Xavier Cugat</PERSON> 

<PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> appeared in several movies in the 1940s, most notably <LOCATION>Bataan</LOCATION> (1943). Shortly after he received his draft notice, but before he was actually inducted, he injured his knee. Although he made it through boot camp, he was eventually classified for limited service, and ended up directing <ORGANIZATION>United Service Organization</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>U.S.O.</LOCATION>) programs at a military hospital in the <LOCATION>San Fernando Valley</LOCATION>. In his memoirs, he recalled discovering that the first thing soldiers requested was almost invariably a glass of cold milk, so he arranged for beautiful starlets to greet the wounded soldiers as they disembarked and pour milk for them. After leaving the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings. After he became engaged in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll throughout the period he remained an active producer.

On October 15, 1951, <PERSON>Desi</PERSON> produced and starred in I Love <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> in which he played a fictitious version of himself, <LOCATION>Cuban</LOCATION> orchestra leader <PERSON>Enrique</PERSON> "Ricky" <PERSON>Ricardo</PERSON>. His co-star was his real-life wife, <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>, who played <PERSON>Ricky</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series My Favorite Husband for television. Ball insisted on <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> playing her on-air spouse so the two would be able to spend more time together. The original premise was for the couple to portray <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Larry Lopez</PERSON>, a successful show business couple (he a band leader, she an actress) whose glamorous careers interfered with their efforts to maintain a normal marriage. Market research indicated, however, that this scenario would not be popular, so <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> changed it to make <PERSON>Ricky</PERSON> a struggling young orchestra leader and <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> an ordinary housewife who had show business fantasies but no talent. <PERSON>Desi</PERSON> would often appear at, and later own, the <ORGANIZATION>Tropicana Club</ORGANIZATION> which, under his ownership, he renamed Club Babalu. Initially, the idea of having Ball and the distinctly Latino <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> portray a married couple encountered resistance as they were told that <PERSON>Desi</PERSON>'s Cuban accent and Latin style would not be agreeable to American viewers. The couple overcame these objections, however, by touring together in a live vaudeville act they developed with the help of Spanish clown <PERSON>Pepito Prez</PERSON>, together with <PERSON>Ball</PERSON>'s radio show writers. Much of the material from their vaudeville act was used in the original "I Love Lucy" pilot, including <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>'s memorable seal routine. (The pilot originally ran as the sixth episode of the show's first season.)

With Ball, he founded Desilu Productions. At this time, most television programs were broadcast live and, as the largest markets were in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the rest of the country received only kinescope images. <PERSON>Karl Freund</PERSON>, <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON>'s cameraman, developed the multiple-camera setup production style using adjacent sets that became the standard for all subsequent situation comedies to this day. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> was told that it would be impossible to allow an audience onto a sound stage, but he worked with <PERSON>Freund</PERSON> to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and also adhere to fire and safety codes.

Network executives considered the use of film an unnecessary extravagance. <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> convinced them to allow Desilu to cover all additional costs associated with the filming process, under the stipulation that Desilu owned and controlled all rights to the film. <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON>'s unprecedented arrangement is widely considered to be one of the shrewdest deals in television history. As a result of his foresight, Desilu reaped the profits from all reruns of the series.

<PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> also pushed the network to allow them to show <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> while she was pregnant. According to <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON>, the CBS network told him, "You cannot show a pregnant woman on television." <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> consulted a priest, a rabbi, and a minister, all of whom told him that there would be nothing wrong with showing a pregnant <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> or with using the word pregnant. The network finally relented and let <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> and Ball weave the pregnancy into the story line, but remained adamant about eschewing use of pregnant, so <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> substituted expecting, pronouncing it  'spectin'  in his Cuban accent. Oddly, the official title of the episode announcing the pregnancy was "Lucy Is Enceinte," employing the French word for pregnant.

In addition to I Love <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>, he produced December Bride, The Mothers-in-Law, The Lucy Show, Those <ORGANIZATION>Whiting Girls</ORGANIZATION>, Our Miss <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON>, The <PERSON>Danny Thomas Show</PERSON>, The <PERSON>Andy Griffith</PERSON> Show, and The Untouchables, <ORGANIZATION>Star Trek TOS</ORGANIZATION> all Top shows in their time, and the 1956 feature film Forever, Darling, in which he and Ball starred. His foresight in filming and retaining post-broadcast ownership of shows had a huge impact on the future of television syndication (reruns).

<PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ball</PERSON> avoided ethnic jokes. <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of <PERSON>Ricky Ricardo</PERSON>'s accent, and noted that even these jokes worked only when <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>, as his wife, did the mimicking.

<PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> was patriotic; in his memoirs, the first object of thanks is the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> itself: "I know of no other country in the world", he wrote, in which "a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language" could reach the success he had. Over the show's six-year run, the fortunes of the <ORGANIZATION>Ricardos</ORGANIZATION> mirror that of the archetypal 1950s American Dream: At first, they live in a tiny brownstone apartment; <PERSON>Ricky</PERSON>'s fortunes continue to improve, and they move into a slightly larger one with a view after <PERSON>Little Ricky</PERSON> is born. Later, <PERSON>Ricky</PERSON> gets his big break and goes to <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>; shortly after returning to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, all of them have the chance to travel through <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Finally, <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ricky</PERSON> head for a house in the wealthy <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> country.

<PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> married <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> on November 30, 1940, and she initiated divorce proceedings in 1944, but returned to him before the interlocutory decree became final. He and <PERSON>Ball</PERSON> are the parents of actress <PERSON>Lucie Arnaz</PERSON> (born 1951) and actor <PERSON>Desi Arnaz</PERSON>, Jr. (born 1953).

<PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON>'s marriage with <PERSON>Ball</PERSON> began to collapse under the strain of his serious problems with alcohol, drugs, and womanizing. According to his memoir, the combined pressures of managing the production company as well as supervising its day-to-day operations had greatly worsened as it grew much larger. <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> was also suffering from diverticulitis. He and <PERSON>Ball</PERSON> divorced in 1960; she was 48 and he was 43. When <PERSON>Ball</PERSON> returned to weekly television, she and <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> worked out an agreement regarding Desilu, wherein she bought him out.

<PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> married his second wife, <PERSON>Edith Mack Hirsch</PERSON>, on March 2, 1963, and greatly reduced his show business activities. He served as executive producer of <ORGANIZATION>The Mothers-in-Law</ORGANIZATION>, and during its two-year run, made four guest appearances as a <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> matador, <PERSON>Seor Delgado</PERSON>. He was widowed in 1985, when his wife <PERSON>Edith</PERSON> died.

Although <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> remarried after his divorce from Ball in 1960, they remained friends. Family home movies later aired on television showed <PERSON>Ball</PERSON> and <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> playing together with their grandson, <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> (or "Simn", if <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON>'s mock protests are to be believed), shortly before <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON>'s death.

In the 1970s, <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> co-hosted a week of shows with daytime TV host/producer <PERSON>Mike Douglas</PERSON>. <PERSON>Vivian Vance</PERSON> appeared as a guest. <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> also headlined a Kraft Music Hall special on <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> that featured his two children, with a brief appearance by <PERSON>Vance</PERSON>. To promote his autobiography, A Book, <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON>, on February 21, 1976, served as a guest host on Saturday Night Live, with his son, <PERSON>Desi, Jr.</PERSON>, also appearing. The program contained spoofs of I Love <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> and The Untouchables. He also read <PERSON>Lewis Carroll</PERSON>'s poem "Jabberwocky" in a heavy Cuban accent (he pronounced it "Habberwocky"). <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jr.</PERSON> played the drums and, supported by the SNL band, <PERSON>Desi</PERSON> sang both "Babalu" and another favorite from his dance band days, "Cuban Pete"; the arrangements similar to the ones used on I Love <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON>. He ended the broadcast by leading the entire cast in a raucous conga line through the SNL studio.

<PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> and his wife eventually moved to <LOCATION>Del Mar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, where he lived the rest of his life in semi-retirement. He owned a 45-acre (18 ha) horse breeding farm in <LOCATION>Corona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, and raced thoroughbreds. He contributed to charitable and non-profit organizations, including <ORGANIZATION>San Diego State University</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON> would make a guest appearance on the TV series <PERSON>Alice</PERSON>, starring <PERSON>Linda Lavin</PERSON> and produced by I Love <PERSON>Lucy</PERSON> co-creators <PERSON>Madelyn Pugh</PERSON> (<PERSON>Madelyn Davis</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Bob Carroll</PERSON>, Jr.

<PERSON>Arnaz</PERSON>, a lifelong smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer in early 1986. He died several months later on December 2, 1986, at age 69. Two days earlier, on what would have been his and <PERSON>Lucille</PERSON>'s 46th wedding anniversary (November 30), she telephoned him. They shared a few words, mostly "I love you's." She said "All right, honey. I'll talk to you later." She was, in fact, the last person to ever speak with <PERSON>Desi Arnaz</PERSON>. His death came just five days before <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON> received the Kennedy Center Honors.

<PERSON>Desi</PERSON> was survived by his mother, <PERSON>Dolores</PERSON>, who died in 1988 at the age of 94.

<PERSON>Desi Arnaz</PERSON> has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one at 6327 <LOCATION>Hollywood Boulevard</LOCATION> for contributions to motion pictures, and one at 6220 <LOCATION>Hollywood Boulevard</LOCATION> for television. There is a <ORGANIZATION>Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Center</ORGANIZATION> museum in <LOCATION>Jamestown</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> (birthplace of <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>) and a <PERSON>Desi Arnaz Bandshell</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Lucille Ball Memorial Park</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Celoron</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> (childhood home of <PERSON>Lucille Ball</PERSON>).









<TITLE><PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin</PERSON> (; ) (1 February 1931 23 April 2007) was the first President of the <LOCATION>Russian Federation</LOCATION>, serving from 1991 to 1999.

<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> came to power with a wave of high expectations. On 12 June 1991 he was elected president of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic with 57% of the vote, becoming the first popularly elected president. But <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> never recovered his popularity after a series of economic and political crises in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> in the 1990s. The <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> era was marked by widespread corruption, economic collapse, and enormous political and social problems. By the time he left office, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> had an approval rating of two percent by some estimates.

Following the dissolution of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> in December 1991, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>, vowing to transform <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s socialist command economy into a free market economy, endorsed price liberalization and privatization programs. Due to corruption and other factors, a good deal of the national wealth fell into the hands of a relatively small group of people. 

In August 1991, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> won international plaudits for casting himself as a democrat and defying the August coup attempt of 1991 by the members of Soviet government opposed to perestroika. He left office widely unpopular with the Russian population as an ineffectual and ailing autocrat. He either acted as his own prime minister (until June 1992) or appointed men of his choice, regardless of parliament. His confrontations with parliament climaxed in the October 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, when <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> called up tanks to shell the Russian White House, blasting out his opponents in parliament. Later in 1993, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> imposed a new constitution with strong presidential powers, which was approved by referendum in December.

Just hours before the first day of 2000, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> made a surprise announcement of his resignation, leaving the presidency in the hands of <PERSON>Vladimir Putin</PERSON>.

<PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON> was born in the village of <LOCATION>Butka</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. His father, <PERSON>Nikolay Yeltsin</PERSON>, was convicted of anti-Soviet agitation in 1934 and sentenced to hard labour in a gulag for three years. Following his release he remained unemployed for a period of time and then worked in construction. His mother, <PERSON>Klavdiya Vasilyevna Yeltsina</PERSON>, worked as a seamstress. 

<PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON> studied at <ORGANIZATION>Pushkin High School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Berezniki</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Perm Krai</LOCATION>. He was fond of sports (in particular skiing, gymnastics, volleyball, track and field, boxing and wrestling) despite losing the thumb and index finger of his left hand when he and some friends sneaked into a <ORGANIZATION>Red Army</ORGANIZATION> supply depot, stole several grenades, and tried to dissect them.

<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> received his higher education at the <ORGANIZATION>Ural State Technical University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Sverdlovsk</LOCATION>, majoring in construction, and graduated in 1955. The subject of his degree paper was "Television Tower".

From 1955 to 1957 he worked as a foreman with the building trust Uraltyazhtrubstroy and from 1957 to 1963 he worked in <LOCATION>Sverdlovsk</LOCATION>, and was promoted from construction site superintendent to chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Construction Directorate</ORGANIZATION> with the Yuzhgorstroy Trust. In 1963 he became chief engineer, and in 1965 head of the <LOCATION>Sverdlovsk</LOCATION> House-Building Combine, responsible for sewerage and technical plumbing. He joined the ranks of the <ORGANIZATION>CPSU</ORGANIZATION> nomenklatura in 1968 when he was appointed head of construction with the <ORGANIZATION>Sverdlovsk Regional Party Committee</ORGANIZATION>. In 1975 he became secretary of the regional committee in charge of the region's industrial development. In 1976 the Politburo of the <ORGANIZATION>CPSU</ORGANIZATION> promoted him to the post of the first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>CPSU Committee of Sverdlovsk Oblast</ORGANIZATION> (effectively he became the head of one of the most important industrial regions in the <ORGANIZATION>USSR</ORGANIZATION>), he remained in this position till 1985.

<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>CPSU</ORGANIZATION>) from 1961 to July 1990, and began working in the Communist administration in 1968. He later commented on his communist views:

In 1977 as party boss in <LOCATION>Sverdlovsk</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>--on orders from <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>--ordered the destruction of the <ORGANIZATION>Ipatiev House</ORGANIZATION> where the last Russian tsar had been killed by Bolshevik troops. The Ipatiev House was demolished in one night, 27 July 1977. Also during <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s stay in <LOCATION>Sverdlovsk</LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION>CPSU</ORGANIZATION> palace was built which was named "White Tooth" by the residents.. During this time, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> developed connections with key people in the Soviet power structure.

He was appointed to the Politburo, and was also "Mayor" of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> (First Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>CPSU Moscow City Committee</ORGANIZATION>) from 24 December 1985 to 1987. He was promoted to these high rank positions by <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> and <PERSON>Yegor Ligachev</PERSON>, who presumed that <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> would be their man. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was also given a country house (dacha) previously occupied by <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>. During this period <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> portrayed himself as a reformer and populist (for example, he took a trolleybus to work), firing and reshuffling his staff several times. His initiatives became popular among <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> residents.

In 1987, after a confrontation with hardliner <PERSON>Yegor Ligachev</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> about <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Raisa</PERSON>, meddling in affairs of the state, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was sacked from his high ranking party positions. On 21 October 1987 at the plenary meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Central Committee</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>CPSU</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>, without prior approval from <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>, lashed out at the Politburo. He expressed his discontent with both the slow pace of reform in society and the servility shown to the General Secretary, then asked to resign from the Politburo, adding that the <ORGANIZATION>City Committee</ORGANIZATION> would decide whether he should resign from the post of first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Moscow City Party Committee</ORGANIZATION>. In his reply, <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> accused <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> of "political immaturity" and "absolute irresponsibility", and at the plenary meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Moscow City Party Committee</ORGANIZATION> proposed relieving <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> of his post of first secretary. Nobody backed <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>. Criticism of <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> continued on 11 November 1987 at the meeting of the <ORGANIZATION>Moscow City Party Committee</ORGANIZATION>. After <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> admitted that his speech had been a mistake, he was fired from the post of first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Moscow City Committee</ORGANIZATION>. He was demoted to the position of first deputy commissioner for the <ORGANIZATION>State Committee for Construction</ORGANIZATION>. After being fired, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was hospitalized and later (confirmed by <PERSON>Nikolai Ryzhkov</PERSON>) attempted suicide. He was perturbed and humiliated but began plotting his revenge. His opportunity came with <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s establishment of the <ORGANIZATION>Congress of People's Deputies</ORGANIZATION>. He recovered, and started intensively criticizing <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>, highlighting the slow pace of reform in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> as his major argument.

<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s criticism of the Politburo and <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> led to a smear campaign against him, in which examples of <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s awkward behavior were used against him. An article published in Pravda described him as being drunk at a lecture during his visit to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, an allegation which appeared to be confirmed by a TV account of his speech. However, popular dissatisfaction with the regime was very strong, and these attempts to smear <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> only added to his popularity. In another incident, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> fell from a bridge. Commenting on this event, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> hinted that he was helped to fall from the bridge by the enemies of perestroika, but his opponents suggested that he was simply drunk.



In March 1989, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was elected to the <ORGANIZATION>Congress of People's Deputies</ORGANIZATION> as the delegate from <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> district and gained a seat on the Supreme Soviet. 

On 29 May 1990, he was elected chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR (RSFSR), the post he held until 10 July 1991. He was supported by both democratic and conservative members of the Supreme Soviet, which sought power in the developing political situation in the country. A part of this power struggle was the opposition between power structures of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and the RSFSR. In an attempt to gain more power, on 12 June 1990, the <ORGANIZATION>Congress of People's</ORGANIZATION> Deputies of the RSFSR adopted a declaration of sovereignty and <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> quit the <ORGANIZATION>CPSU</ORGANIZATION> in July 1990.

On 12 June 1991, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> won 57% of the popular vote in the democratic presidential elections for the Russian republic, defeating <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s preferred candidate, <PERSON>Nikolai Ryzhkov</PERSON>. In his election campaign, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> criticized the "dictatorship of the center", but did not suggest the introduction of a market economy. Instead, he said that he would put his head on the railtrack in the event of increased prices. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> took office on 10 July.

On 18 August 1991, a coup against <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> was launched by the government members opposed to perestroika headed by <PERSON>Vladimir Kryuchkov</PERSON>. <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> was held in <LOCATION>Crimea</LOCATION> while <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> raced to the White House of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> (residence of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR) in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> to defy the coup. The White House was surrounded by the military but the troops defected in the face of mass popular demonstrations. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> responded to the coup by making a memorable speech from the turret of a tank. By 21 August most of the coup leaders had fled <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> was "rescued" from <LOCATION>Crimea</LOCATION> and then returned to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was subsequently hailed by his supporters around the world for rallying mass opposition to the coup.

Although restored to his position, <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>'s powers were now fatally compromised. Neither union nor Russian power structures heeded his commands as support had swung over to <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>. Through the fall of 1991, the Russian government took over the union government, ministry by ministry. 

On 6 November 1991, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> issued a decree banning the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> throughout the RSFSR.

In early December 1991, <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> voted for independence from the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. A week later, on 8 December, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> met with <LOCATION>Ukrainian</LOCATION> president <PERSON>Leonid Kravchuk</PERSON> and the leader of <LOCATION>Belarus</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Stanislav Shushkevich</PERSON>, in <LOCATION>Belovezhskaya Pushcha</LOCATION>, where the three presidents announced the dissolution of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> and that they would establish a voluntary Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place. According to <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON>, the president of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> at that time, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> kept the plans of the <LOCATION>Belovezhskaya</LOCATION> meeting in strict secrecy and the main goal of the dissolution of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> was to get rid of <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON>, who by that time had started to recover his position after the events of August. <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> has also accused <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> of violating the people's will expressed in the referendum in which the majority voted to keep the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>.

On 24 December, the <LOCATION>Russian Federation</LOCATION> took the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s seat in the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>. The next day, President <PERSON>Gorbachev</PERSON> resigned and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> ceased to exist, thereby ending the world's largest and most influential socialist state. Economic relations between the former <LOCATION>Soviet</LOCATION> republics were severely compromised. Millions of ethnic Russians found themselves in the newly formed foreign countries.

Just days after the dissolution of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON> resolved to embark on a program of radical economic reform, with the aim of restructuring <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s economic systemconverting the world's largest command economy into a free-market one. During early discussions of this transition, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s advisers debated issues of speed and sequencing, with an apparent division between those favoring a rapid approach and those favoring a gradual or slower approach.

In late 1991 <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> turned to the advice of Western economists, and Western institutions such as the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>World Bank</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION>, who had developed a standard policy recipe for transition economies in the late 1980s. This policy recipe came to be known as the "<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Consensus" or "shock therapy", a combination of measures intended to liberalize prices and stabilize the state's budget. Such measures had been attempted in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, and advocates of "shock therapy" felt the same could be done in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. Some Russian policymakers were skeptical that this was the way to go, but the approach was favored by <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON>Yegor Gaidar</PERSON>, a 35-year-old Russian economist inclined toward radical reform.

On 2 January 1992, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>, acting as his own prime minister, ordered the liberalization of foreign trade, prices, and currency. At the same time, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> followed a policy of 'macroeconomic stabilization,' a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation. Under <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s stabilization program, interest rates were raised to extremely high levels to tighten money and restrict credit. To bring state spending and revenues into balance, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> raised new taxes heavily, cut back sharply on government subsidies to industry and construction, and made steep cuts to state welfare spending.

In early 1992, prices skyrocketed throughout <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, and deep credit crunch shut down many industries and brought about a protracted depression. The reforms devastated the living standards of much of the population, especially the groups dependent on Soviet-era state subsidies and welfare entitlement programs. Through the 1990s, <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s GDP fell by 50 percent, vast sectors of the economy were wiped out, inequality and unemployment grew dramatically, while incomes fell. Hyperinflation, caused by the <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank of Russia</ORGANIZATION>'s loose monetary policy, wiped out a lot of personal savings, and tens of millions of Russians were plunged into poverty.

Some economists argue that in the 1990s <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> suffered an economic downturn more severe than the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> had undergone six decades earlier in the Great Depression. Russian commentators and even some Western economists, such as <PERSON>Marshall Goldman</PERSON>, widely blamed <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s Western-backed economic program for the country's disastrous economic performance in the 1990s. Many politicians began to quickly distance themselves from the program. In February 1992, <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s vice president, <PERSON>Alexander Rutskoy</PERSON> denounced the <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> program as "economic genocide." By 1993 conflict over the reform direction escalated between <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> on the one side, and the opposition to radical economic reform in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s parliament on the other.

Also throughout 1992, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> wrestled with the Supreme Soviet and the <ORGANIZATION>Congress of People's</ORGANIZATION> Deputies for control over government, government policy, government banking and property. In the course of 1992, the speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet, <PERSON>Ruslan Khasbulatov</PERSON>, came out in opposition to the reforms, despite claiming to support <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s overall goals. In December 1992, the <ORGANIZATION>7th Congress of People's Deputies</ORGANIZATION> succeeded in turning down the Yeltsin-backed candidacy of <PERSON>Yegor Gaidar</PERSON> for the position of Russian prime minister. Eventually, on 14 December, <PERSON>Viktor Chernomyrdin</PERSON>, seen as a compromise figure, was confirmed in the office.

The conflict escalated on 20 March 1993 when <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>, in a televised address to the nation, announced that he was going to assume certain "special powers" in order to implement his program of reforms. In response, the hastily-called <ORGANIZATION>9th Congress of People's Deputies</ORGANIZATION> attempted to remove <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> from presidency through impeachment on 26 March 1993. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s opponents gathered more than 600 votes for impeachment, but fell 72 votes short of the required two-thirds majority. On 21 September 1993 <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> announced in a televised address his decision to disband the Supreme Soviet and <ORGANIZATION>Congress of People's</ORGANIZATION> Deputies by decree.

In his address <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> declared his intent to rule by decree until the election of the new parliament and a referendum on a new constitution, triggering the constitutional crisis of October 1993. On the night after <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s televised address, the Supreme Soviet declared <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> removed from presidency, by virtue of his breaching the constitution, and Vice-President <PERSON>Alexander Rutskoy</PERSON> was sworn in as the acting president.

Between 2124 September <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was confronted by significant popular unrest, encouraging the defenders of the parliament. <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> saw what amounted to a spontaneous mass uprising of anti-Yeltsin demonstrators numbering in the tens of thousands marching in the streets resolutely seeking to aid forces defending the parliament building. The demonstrators were protesting the new and terrible living conditions under <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>. Since 1989 GDP had declined by half. Corruption was rampant, violent crime was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing, food and fuel were increasingly scarce and life expectancy was falling for all but a tiny handful of the population; moreover, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was increasingly getting the blame.

By early October, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> had secured the support of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s army and ministry of interior forces. In a massive show of force, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> called up tanks to shell the Russian White House, <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s parliament building, blasting out his opponents. As a result, hundreds died and thousands were wounded. 

As Supreme Soviet was dissolved, in December 1993 elections to the newly established parliament, the State Duma, were held. Candidates associated with <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s economic policies were overwhelmed by a huge anti-Yeltsin vote, the bulk of which was divided between the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> and ultra-nationalists. The referendum, however, held at the same time, approved the new constitution, which significantly expanded the powers of the president, giving <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> a right to appoint the members of the government, to dismiss the prime minister and, in some cases, to dissolve the Duma.



In December 1994, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> ordered the military invasion of <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> in an attempt to restore <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s control over the separatist republic. Nearly two years later <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> withdrew federal forces from the devastated <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> under a 1996 peace agreement brokered by <PERSON>Alexander Lebed</PERSON>, then <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s security chief. The peace deal allowed <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> greater autonomy but not full independence.

The decision to launch the war in <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> dismayed many in the West. TIME magazine wrote: "Then, what was to be made of <PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON>? Clearly he could no longer be regarded as the <ORGANIZATION>democratic</ORGANIZATION> hero of Western myth. But had he become an old- style communist boss, turning his back on the <ORGANIZATION>democratic</ORGANIZATION> reformers he once championed and throwing in his lot with militarists and ultranationalists? Or was he a befuddled, out-of-touch chief being manipulated, knowingly or unwittingly, by well, by whom exactly? If there was to be a dictatorial coup, would <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> be its victim or its leader?"



Following the collapse of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> promoted privatization as a way of spreading ownership of shares in former state enterprises as widely as possible to create political support for his economic reforms. In the West, privatization was viewed as the key to the transition from communism in <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION>, ensuring a quick dismantling of the Soviet-era command economy to make way for 'free market reforms.' In the early 1990s, <PERSON>Anatoly Chubais</PERSON>, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s deputy for economic policy, emerged as a leading advocate of privatization in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>.

In late 1992, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> launched a program of free vouchers as a way to give mass privatization a jump-start. Under the program, all Russian citizens were issued vouchers, each with a nominal value of around 10,000 rubles, for purchase of shares of select state enterprises. Although each citizen initially received a voucher of equal face value, within months most of them converged in the hands of intermediaries who were ready to buy them for cash right away.

In 1995, as <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> struggled to finance <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s growing foreign debt and gain support from the Russian business elite for his bid in the spring 1996 presidential elections, the Russian president prepared for a new wave of privatization offering stock shares in some of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s most valuable state enterprises in exchange for bank loans. The program was promoted as a way of simultaneously speeding up privatization and ensuring the government a much-needed infusion of cash for its operating needs.

However, the deals were effectively giveaways of valuable state assets to a small group of tycoons in finance, industry, energy, telecommunications, and the media who came to be known as "oligarchs" in the mid-1990s. By summer 1996, substantial ownership shares over major firms were acquired at very low prices by a handful of people. <PERSON>Boris Berezovsky</PERSON>, who controlled major stakes in several banks and the national media, emerged as one of <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s most prominent backers. Along with <PERSON>Berezovsky</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mikhail Khodorkovsky</PERSON>, <PERSON>Vladimir Potanin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Vladimir Bogdanov</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rem Viakhirev</PERSON>, <PERSON>Vagit Alekperov</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alexander Smolensky</PERSON>, <PERSON>Victor Vekselberg</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mikhail Fridman</PERSON> and a few years later <PERSON>Roman Abramovich</PERSON>, were habitually mentioned in the media as <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s oligarchs.

On 5 December 1991, Senator <PERSON>Jesse Helms</PERSON>, ranking member of the Minority Staff of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate Committee</ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Relations, wrote to <PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON> concerning <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> servicemen who were POWs or MIAs. "The status of thousands and thousands of American servicemen who are held by Soviet and other Communist forces, and who were never repatriated after every major war this century, is of grave concern to the American people." 

<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> would ultimately respond with a statement made on 15 June 1992, while being interviewed aboard his presidential jet on his way to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, "Our archives have shown that it is true some of them were transferred to the territory of the <LOCATION>U.S.S.R.</LOCATION> and were kept in labor camps... We can only surmise that some of them may still be alive." On 10 December 1991, just five days after Senator <PERSON>Helms</PERSON> had written <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> concerning American servicemen, he again wrote to <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>, this time concerning KAL 007. 

"One of the greatest tragedies of the Cold War was the shoot-down of the <ORGANIZATION>Korean Airlines</ORGANIZATION> Flight 007 by the Armed Forces of what was then the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> on 1 September 1983... The KAL-007 tragedy was one of the most tense incidences of the entire Cold War. However, now that relations between our two nations have improved substantially, I believe that it is time to resolve the mysteries surrounding this event. 

Clearing the air on this issue could help further to improve relations." In March of 1992, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> would hand over KAL 007's Black Box without its tapes to Korean President <PERSON>Roh Tae-Woo</PERSON> at the end of the plenary session of the <ORGANIZATION>Korean National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> with this statement, "We apologize for the tragedy and are trying to settle some unsolved issues."

<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> would ultimately respond on 8 January 1992 by handing over to the <ORGANIZATION>International Civil Aviation Organization</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>ICAO</ORGANIZATION>) of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> what the Russians had for so many years denied possessing: the tapes of the <ORGANIZATION>KAL 007</ORGANIZATION>'s "Black Box" (its Digital Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder). 

The openness of <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> about POW/MIA and <ORGANIZATION>KAL</ORGANIZATION> 007 matters may also have signaled his willingness for more openness to the West. In 1992, which he labelled the "window of opportunity", he was willing to discuss biological weapons with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> but never admitted that the <LOCATION>Sverdlovsk</LOCATION> anthrax leak of 2 April 1979 had been caused as a result of a mishap at a military facility. The Russian government has maintained that the cause was contaminated meat. The true number of victims in the anthrax outbreak at <LOCATION>Sverdlovsk</LOCATION>, about  east of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, is not known.

In February 1996, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> announced that he would seek a second term in the spring 1996 Russian presidential election. The announcement followed weeks of speculation that <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was at the end of his political career because of his health problems and growing unpopularity in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. At the time <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was recuperating from a series of heart attacks. Domestic and international observers also noted his occasionally erratic behaviour. When campaigning opened at the beginning of 1996, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s popularity was close to zero. Meanwhile, the opposition <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party of the Russian Federation</ORGANIZATION> had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, <PERSON>Gennady Zyuganov</PERSON>, had a strong grass roots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of the old days of Soviet prestige on the international stage and the socialist domestic order.

Panic struck the <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> team when opinion polls suggested that the ailing president could not win; some members of his entourage urged him to cancel presidential elections and effectively rule as dictator from then on. Instead, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> changed his campaign team, assigning a key role to his daughter, <PERSON>Tatyana Dyachenko</PERSON>, and appointing <PERSON>Chubais</PERSON> as campaign manager. <PERSON>Chubais</PERSON>, acting as both <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s campaign manager and adviser on <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s privatisation programme, used his control of the privatisation programme as an instrument of <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s reelection campaign.

In the spring of 1996, <PERSON>Chubais</PERSON> and <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> recruited a team of a handful of financial and media oligarchs to bankroll the <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> campaign and guaranteed favorable media coverage the president on national television and in leading newspapers. In return, <PERSON>Chubais</PERSON> allowed well-connected Russian business leaders to acquire majority stakes in some of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s most valuable state-owned assets. The media painted a picture of a fateful choice for <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, between <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> and a "return to totalitarianism." The oligarchs even played up the threat of civil war if a Communist were elected president.Yeltsin campaigned energetically, dispelling concerns about his health, and maintained a high media profile. To boost his popularity, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> promised to abandon some his more unpopular economic reforms, boost welfare spending, end the war in <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION>, and pay wage and pension arrears. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s campaign also got a boost from the announcement of a $10 billion loan to the Russian government from the International Monetary Fund.

<PERSON>Zyuganov</PERSON>, who lacked <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s resources and financial backing, saw his strong initial lead whittle away. After the first round on 16 June <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> appointed a highly popular candidate <PERSON>Alexander Lebed</PERSON>, who came in third in the first round, Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council of Russia</ORGANIZATION>, sacked at the latter's behest defence minister <PERSON>Pavel Grachev</PERSON> and on 20 June sacked a number of his siloviki, one of them being his chief of presidential security <PERSON>Alexander Korzhakov</PERSON>, viewed by many as <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s minence grise.

In the run-off on 3 July, with a turnout of 68.9%, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> won 53.8% of the vote and <PERSON>Zyuganov</PERSON> 40.3%, with the rest (5.9%) voting "against all".

In his second term, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was unable to follow through on most of his campaign promises, except for ending the Chechen war, which was halted for most of the period.



In July 1996, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was re-elected as president with financial support from influential business oligarchs who owed their wealth to their connections with <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s administration. Despite only gaining 35% of the first round vote in the 1996 elections, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> defeated his communist rival <PERSON>Gennady Zyuganov</PERSON> with 54% in the runoff election. Later that year, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> underwent an emergency quintuple heart bypass surgery and remained in the hospital for months.

During <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s presidency, <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> received US$ 40 billion in funds from the <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> and other international lending organizations. However, his opponents allege that most of these funds were stolen by people from <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s circle and placed in foreign banks.

In 1998, a political and economic crisis emerged when <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s government defaulted on its debts, causing financial markets to panic and the ruble to collapse in the 1998 financial crisis.

During the 1999 <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> war, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> strongly opposed the <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> military campaign against <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION>, and warned of possible <LOCATION>Russian</LOCATION> intervention if <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> deployed ground troops to <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION>. In televised comments he stated: "I told <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>, the Americans, the Germans: Don't push us toward military action. Otherwise there will be a European war for sure and possibly world war."

On 15 May 1999, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> survived another attempt of impeachment, this time by the democratic and communist opposition in the State Duma. He was charged with several unconstitutional activities, including the signing of the Belavezha Accords, dissolving the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> in December 1991, the coup-d'tat in October 1993, and initiating the war in <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> in 1994. None of these charges received the two-thirds majority of the Duma which was required to initiate the process of impeachment of the president.

On 9 August 1999 <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> fired his prime minister, <PERSON>Sergei Stepashin</PERSON>, and for the fourth time, fired his entire cabinet. In <PERSON>Stepashin</PERSON>'s place he appointed <PERSON>Vladimir Putin</PERSON>, relatively unknown at that time, and announced his wish to see <PERSON>Putin</PERSON> as his successor.

In late 1999 <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> and President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> openly disagreed on the war in <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION>. At the November meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> pointed his finger at <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> and demanded he halt bombing attacks that had resulted in many civilian casualties. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> immediately left the conference.

In December while visiting <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to seek support on <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> replied to <PERSON>Clintons</PERSON> criticism of a Russian ultimatum to citizens of <LOCATION>Grozney</LOCATION>. He bluntly pronounced: "Yesterday, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> permitted himself to put pressure on <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. It seems he has for a minute, for a second, for half a minute, forgotten that <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> has a full arsenal of nuclear weapons. He has forgotten about that." <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> dismissed <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s comments stating: "I didn't think he'd forgotten that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> was a great power when he disagreed with what I did in <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION>." It fell to <PERSON>Vladimir Putin</PERSON> to downplay <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s comments and present reassurances about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Russian relations.

On 31 December 1999, in a surprise announcement aired at 12:00 noon on Russian television and taped in the morning of the same day, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> said he had resigned and Prime Minister <PERSON>Vladimir Putin</PERSON> had taken over as acting president, with elections due to take place on 26 March 2000. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> asked for forgiveness for what he acknowledged were errors of his rule, and said <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> needed to enter the new century with new political leaders. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> said: "I want to beg forgiveness for your dreams that never came true. And also I would like to beg forgiveness not to have justified your hopes."

According to numerous reports, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> struggled with alcoholism. The subject made headlines abroad during <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in 1989 for a series of lectures on social and political life in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. That trip was described by a report in the Italian newspaper <ORGANIZATION>La Repubblica</ORGANIZATION>. The article reported that <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> often appeared drunk in public. The article was reprinted by Pravda. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s alleged alcoholism was also the subject of media discussion following his meeting with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON>Strobe Talbott</PERSON> following <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s inauguration in 1993 and after his flight stop-over at <LOCATION>Shannon Airport</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> in September 1994 when the waiting Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) <PERSON>Albert Reynolds</PERSON> was told that <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was unwell and would not be leaving the aircraft.

According to former Deputy Prime Minister of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> <PERSON>Boris Nemtsov</PERSON>, the bizarre behavior of <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> resulted from "strong drugs" given to him by <PERSON>Kremlin</PERSON>'s doctors, which were incompatible even with a small amount of alcohol. This was discussed by journalist <PERSON>Yelena Tregubova</PERSON> from the "Kremlin's pool" in connection with an episode during <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> in 1997 when <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> suddenly started talking nonsense (he allegedly told his bemused audience that Swedish meatballs reminded him of <PERSON>Bjrn Borg</PERSON>'s face), lost his balance, and almost fell down on the podium after drinking a single glass of Champagne <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>, in his memoirs, claimed no recollection of the event but did however make a passing reference to the incident when he met <PERSON>Borg</PERSON> a year later at The World Circle Kabaddi Cup in <LOCATION>Hamilton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>, where the pair had been invited to present the trophy. Similarly, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> made a hasty withdrawal from the funeral of <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION> in February 1999. (Russian: . ., M., Ad <PERSON>Marginem</PERSON>, 2003 ISBN 5-93321-073-0 Full text in Russian. German translation. 

After <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s death, a Dutch neurosurgeon revealed that his team was secretly flown to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> to operate on <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> in 1999. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> suffered from an unspecified neurological disorder that affected his sense of balance, causing him to wobble as if in a drunken state; the goal of the operation was to reduce the pain.

<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s personal and health problems received a great deal of attention in the global press. As the years went on, he was often viewed as an increasingly unstable leader, rather than the inspiring figure he was once seen as. The possibility that he might die in office was often discussed.Starting in the last years of his presidential term, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s primary residence was the Gorki-9 presidential dacha west of <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. He made frequent stays at the nearby government sanatorium in <LOCATION>Barvikha</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> maintained a low profile after his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances. However, on 13 September 2004, following the <LOCATION>Beslan</LOCATION> school hostage crisis and nearly-concurrent terrorist attacks in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Putin</PERSON> launched an initiative to replace the election of regional governors with a system whereby they would be directly appointed by the president and approved by regional legislatures. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>, together with <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON>, publicly criticized <PERSON>Putin</PERSON>'s plan as a step away from democracy in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and a return to the centrally-run political apparatus of the Soviet era.

In September 2005, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> underwent a hip operation in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> after breaking his femur in a fall while vacationing on the Italian island of <LOCATION>Sardinia</LOCATION>.

On 1 February 2006, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> celebrated his 75th birthday. He used this occasion as an opportunity to criticize a "monopolistic" <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> foreign policy, and to state that <PERSON>Vladimir Putin</PERSON> was the right choice for <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. He also disputed accusations of corruption.

<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> also used his retirement to pursue his considerable love of tennis. He was a frequent fixture at tournaments held in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, notably Russian Davis Cup and Federation Cup team events. Far from a passive supporter like many VIPs who attend sports events, <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> gained a reputation as an animated fan, cheering and jumping in support of the Russians. When the Russian men won the Davis Cup in 2002 and 2006 <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> descended the stands to celebrate with the players, group hugging the team.

Following his death in April 2007, his widow, <PERSON>Naina</PERSON>, attended in <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s place the final of that year's Federation Cup, in which <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s women comprehensively beat <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON> died of congestive heart failure on 23 April 2007 at the age of 76. According to experts quoted by <ORGANIZATION>Komsomolskaya Pravda</ORGANIZATION>, the onset of <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s condition was due to his visit to Jordan between 25 March and 2 April. He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery on 25 April 2007, following a period during which his body had lain in state in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was the first Russian statesman in 113 years to be buried in a church ceremony, after Emperor <PERSON>Alexander III</PERSON>. He was also the first leader in Russian and Soviet history to die quietly in retirement having overseen a peaceful transfer to his successor, <PERSON>Lenin</PERSON> being forced to retire by illness and <PERSON>Khrushchev</PERSON> being ousted in a coup. 

President <PERSON>Putin</PERSON> declared the day of his funeral a national day of mourning, with flags flown at half-staff and all entertainment programs suspended for the day. 

<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON>Naina Iosifovna Yeltsina</PERSON>, whom he married in 1956, and their two daughters <PERSON>Yelena</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tatyana</PERSON>, born in 1957 and 1959 respectively.

<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s "presidency has inscribed him forever in <LOCATION>Russian</LOCATION> and in world history." ... "A new democratic <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> was born during his time: a free, open and peaceful country. A state in which the power truly does belong to the people." ... "the first President of Russias strength consisted in the mass support of Russian citizens for his ideas and aspirations. Thanks to the will and direct initiative of President <PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON> a new constitution, one which declared human rights a supreme value, was adopted. It gave people the opportunity to freely express their thoughts, to freely choose power in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, to realise their creative and entrepreneurial plans. This Constitution permitted us to begin building a truly effective Federation." ... "We knew (<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>) as a brave and a warm-hearted, spiritual person. He was an upstanding and courageous national leader. And he was always very honest and frank while defending his position." ... "(<PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>) assumed full responsibility for everything he called for, for everything he aspired to. For everything he tried to do and did do for the sake of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, for the sake of millions of Russians. And he invariably took upon himself, let it in his heart, all the trials and tribulations of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, peoples difficulties and problems."Shortly after the news broke, former Soviet leader <PERSON>Mikhail Gorbachev</PERSON> issued a statement, saying:"I offer my deepest condolences to the family of a man on whose shoulders rested many great deeds for the good of the country and serious mistakesa tragic fate".

<PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> (February 12, 1809 - April 15, 1865), the sixteenth President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, successfully led his country through its greatest internal crisis, the American Civil War, only to be assassinated as the war was coming to an end.

As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his time in office, he contributed to the effort to preserve the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> by leading the defeat of the secessionist <ORGANIZATION>Confederate States of America</ORGANIZATION> in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which passed <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s death and was ratified by the states later in 1865.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> successfully defused a war scare with the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> in 1861. Under his leadership, the Union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election.

Opponents of the war (also known as "Copperheads") criticized <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans, an abolitionist faction of the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION>, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these road blocks, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Address</ORGANIZATION> is but one example of this. At the close of the war, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> held a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history and made him a martyr for the ideal of national unity.



<PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> was born on February 12, 1809, to <PERSON>Thomas Lincoln</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nancy Hanks</PERSON>, two uneducated farmers, in a one-room log cabin on the  Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast <LOCATION>Hardin County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> (now part of <LOCATION>LaRue County</LOCATION>), making him the first president born outside the original Thirteen Colonies. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s ancestor <PERSON>Samuel Lincoln</PERSON> had arrived in <LOCATION>Hingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> in the 17th century, but his descendants had gradually moved west, from <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and then westward to the frontier.

For some time, <PERSON>Thomas Lincoln</PERSON>, <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON>'s father, was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> backcountry. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt. The family belonged to a Hardshell Baptist church, although <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> himself never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.

In 1816, the <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> family was forced to make a new start in <LOCATION>Perry County</LOCATION> (now in <LOCATION>Spencer County</LOCATION>), <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>. He later noted that this move was "partly on account of slavery," and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>: Unlike land in the <LOCATION>Northwest Territory</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> never had a proper <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property.

When <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was nine, his mother, then 34 years old, died of milk sickness. Soon afterwards, his father remarried to <PERSON>Sarah Bush Johnston</PERSON>. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was affectionate toward his stepmother, whom he would call "Mother" for the rest of his life, but he was distant from his father.

In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>, the family settled on public land in <LOCATION>Macon County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>. The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION>. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in <LOCATION>Coles County</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, 22-year-old <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> struck out on his own, canoeing down the <LOCATION>Sangamon River</LOCATION> to the village of <LOCATION>New Salem</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Sangamon County</LOCATION>. Later that year, hired by <LOCATION>New Salem</LOCATION> businessman <PERSON>Denton Offutt</PERSON> and accompanied by friends, he took goods from <LOCATION>New Salem</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION> via flatboat on the <LOCATION>Sangamon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> rivers.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling, but he was largely self-educated and an avid reader. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an axe. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. At 6 foot 4 inches (1.93 m), he was unusually tall, as well as strong.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois General Assembly</ORGANIZATION>, as a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Whig Party</ORGANIZATION>. The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the <LOCATION>Sangamon River</LOCATION>. He believed that this would attract steamboat traffic, which would allow the sparsely populated, poorer areas along the river to flourish.

He was elected captain of an <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> militia company drawn from <LOCATION>New Salem</LOCATION> during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had "any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction."

For several months, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> ran a small store in <LOCATION>New Salem</LOCATION>. In 1834, he won election to the state legislature, and, after coming across the Commentaries on the Laws of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, began to teach himself law. Admitted to the bar in 1837, he moved to <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, that same year and began to practice law with <PERSON>John T. Stuart</PERSON>. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> became an able and successful lawyer.

He served four successive terms in the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> as a representative from <LOCATION>Sangamon County</LOCATION>, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837, he made his first protest against slavery in the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois House</ORGANIZATION>, stating that the institution was "founded on both injustice and bad policy." It was also in this same year that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> met <PERSON>Joshua Fry Speed</PERSON>, who would become a close friend.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> wrote a series of anonymous letters, published in 1842 in the <ORGANIZATION>Sangamon Journal</ORGANIZATION>, mocking State Auditor and prominent Democrat <PERSON>James Shields</PERSON>. Two years later, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> entered law practice with <PERSON>William Herndon</PERSON>, a fellow Whig. In 1854, both men joined the fledgling <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION>. Following <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s death, <PERSON>Herndon</PERSON> began collecting stories about <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> and published them in <PERSON>Herndon</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>.



On November 4, 1842 <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> married <PERSON>Mary Todd</PERSON>, daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>. The couple had four sons. <PERSON>Robert Todd Lincoln</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> on August 1, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION>Phillips Exeter Academy</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Harvard College</ORGANIZATION>.

The other <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> children were born in <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, and died either during childhood or their teen years. <PERSON>Edward Baker Lincoln</PERSON> was born on March 10, 1846, and died on February 1, 1850, also in <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>. <PERSON>William</PERSON> "Willie" <PERSON>Wallace Lincoln</PERSON> was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, during President <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s first term. <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> "Tad" <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was born on April 4, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>.

A Whig and an admirer of party leader <PERSON>Henry Clay</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was elected to a term in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> in 1846. As a freshman House member, he was not a particularly powerful or influential figure. However, he spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he attributed to President <PERSON>Polk</PERSON>'s desire for "military glory" and challenged the President's claims regarding the <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> boundary and offered Spot Resolutions, demanding to know on what "spot" on <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> soil that blood was first spilt.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> later damaged his political reputation with a speech in which he declared, "God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just." Two weeks later, President <PERSON>Polk</PERSON> sent a peace treaty to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. While no one in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> paid any attention to <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>, the Democrats orchestrated angry outbursts from across his district, where the war was popular and many had volunteered.

Warned by his law partner, <PERSON>William Herndon</PERSON>, that the damage was mounting and irreparable, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> decided not to run for reelection. His statements were not easily forgotten, and would haunt him during the Civil War. These statements were also held against him when he applied for a position in the new <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> administration. Instead, <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON>'s people offered <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> various positions in the remote <LOCATION>Oregon Territory</LOCATION>, primarily the governorship. Acceptance of this offer would have ended his career in the rapidly growing state of <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, so <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> declined the position. Returning to <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> gave up politics for several years and turned his energies to his law practice.

By the mid-1850s, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s caseload focused largely on the competing transportation interests of river barges and railroads. In one prominent 1851 case, he represented the <ORGANIZATION>Alton & Sangamon Railroad</ORGANIZATION> in a dispute with a shareholder, <PERSON>James A. Barret</PERSON>. <PERSON>Barret</PERSON> had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to the railroad on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer route proposed by <ORGANIZATION>Alton & Sangamon</ORGANIZATION> was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly, the corporation had a right to sue <PERSON>Barret</PERSON> for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.

The civil case which won <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> fame as a lawyer was the landmark <ORGANIZATION>Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company</ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s expansion west, which <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> strongly supported, was seen as an economic threat to the river trade, which ran north-to-south, primarily on the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> river. In 1856 a steamboat collided with a bridge, built by the Rock Island Railroad, between <LOCATION>Rock Island</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Davenport</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION>, the first railroad bridge to span the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. The steamboat owner sued for damages, claiming the bridge was a hazard to navigation. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> argued in court for the railroad and won, removing a costly impediment to western expansion by establishing the right of land routes to bridge waterways.

Possibly the most notable criminal trial of <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s career as a lawyer came in 1858, when he defended <PERSON>William "Duff" Armstrong</PERSON>, who had been charged with murder. The case became famous for <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s use of judicial notice a rare tactic at that time to show that an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime by moonlight, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> produced a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle that it could not have provided enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based almost entirely on this evidence, <PERSON>Armstrong</PERSON> was acquitted.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was involved in more than 5,100 cases in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> alone during his 23-year legal career. Though many of these cases involved little more than filing a writ, others were more substantial and quite involved. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> and his partners appeared before the <ORGANIZATION>Illinois State Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> more than 400 times.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> returned to politics in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the Missouri Compromise (1820). <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON>Stephen A. Douglas</PERSON>, the most powerful man in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>-<LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> Act. <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>.

In the October 16, 1854, "<LOCATION>Peoria</LOCATION> Speech", <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day:



Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, <ORGANIZATION>Free Soil</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Liberty</ORGANIZATION> and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION>. In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> in 1854 and elected a senator. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat <PERSON>Lyman Trumbull</PERSON>. At the Republican convention in 1856, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for Vice-President.

In 1857-58, <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> broke with President <PERSON>Buchanan</PERSON>, leading to a fight for control of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the <ORGANIZATION>Lecompton Constitution</ORGANIZATION>, which would have admitted <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> as a slave state. Accepting the Republican nomination for <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in 1858, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> delivered his famous speech: "'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'(Mark 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved I do not expect the house to fall but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other." The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the north.

The 1858 campaign featured the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a famous contest on slavery. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> warned that "The Slave Power" was threatening the values of republicanism, while <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> emphasized the supremacy of democracy, as set forth in his <ORGANIZATION>Freeport Doctrine</ORGANIZATION>, which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s speeches on the issue transformed him into a national political star.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was chosen as the <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals <PERSON>William H. Seward</PERSON> and <PERSON>Salmon P. Chase</PERSON>. His "Western" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> that the <PERSON>North</PERSON> was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession. On May 9-10, 1860, the <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> Republican State Convention was held in <LOCATION>Decatur</LOCATION>. At this convention, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.

Throughout the general election, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> did not campaign or give speeches. This was handled by the state and county Republican organizations, who used the latest techniques to sustain party enthusiasm and thus obtain high turnout. There was little effort to convert non-Republicans, and there was virtually no campaigning in the South except for a few border cities such as <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, and Wheeling, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>; indeed, the party did not even run a slate in most of the South. In the North, there were thousands of Republican speakers, tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. These focused first on the party platform, and second on <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, "Honest Abe" and "the Rail-Splitter," were exploited to the full. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of "free labor," whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.

On November 6, 1860, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was elected as the 16th President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, beating Democrat <PERSON>Stephen A. Douglas</PERSON>, <PERSON>John C. Breckinridge</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Southern Democrats</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>John Bell</PERSON> of the new <ORGANIZATION>Constitutional Union Party</ORGANIZATION>. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON>, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; <LOCATION>Breckenridge</LOCATION>, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION>, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes. There were fusion tickets in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election.

With the emergence of the Republicans as the nation's first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out. Although much of the West the focal point of sectional tensions was unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation's territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. But they suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>'s election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.

As <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. On December 20, 1860, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> took the lead. By February 1, 1861, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> was followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>. The seven states soon declared themselves to be a new nation, the Confederate States of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. The upper South (<LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President <PERSON>Buchanan</PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> refused to recognize the Confederacy.

Attempts at compromise, such as the <ORGANIZATION>Crittenden Compromise</ORGANIZATION> which would have extended the Missouri line of 1820, were discussed. Despite support for the Crittenden Compromise among some Republicans, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> denounced it in private letters, saying "either the Missouri line extended, or... Pop. <PERSON>Sov</PERSON>. would lose us everything we gained in the election; that filibustering for all South of us, and making slave states of it, would follow in spite of us, under either plan",while other Republicans publicly stated it "would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and <LOCATION>Tierra del Fuego</LOCATION> [at the far end of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>]."

President-elect <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> evaded possible assassins in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C</LOCATION>.

At his inauguration on March 4, 1861, the German American Turners formed <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the capital from Confederate invasion and local insurrection. In his <ORGANIZATION>First Inaugural Address</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> declared, "I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments," arguing further that the purpose of the <ORGANIZATION>United States Constitution</ORGANIZATION> was "to form a more perfect union" than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?

Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> supported the pending Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already passed <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed, had more appeal to the critical border states than to the states that had already declared their separation.

By the time <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. <PERSON>Buchanan</PERSON> might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as <PERSON>Jeremiah S. Black</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joseph Holt</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Edwin M. Stanton</PERSON> had taken control of <PERSON>Buchanan</PERSON>'s cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. Believing that a peaceful solution was still possible, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> decided to not take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.

Historian <PERSON>Allan Nevins</PERSON> argues that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He "temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis", overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states. In connection with <PERSON>Nevins</PERSON>'s conclusions, it is interesting to note an incident from this period reported in the memoirs of <PERSON>William Tecumseh Sherman</PERSON>. Then a civilian, <PERSON>Sherman</PERSON> visited <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> during inauguration week, with his brother, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> Republican <PERSON>John Sherman</PERSON>. This meeting left the future General <PERSON>Sherman</PERSON> "sadly disappointed" at <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s seeming failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and the South was "'preparing for war.'"

In April 1861, after Union troops at <LOCATION>Fort Sumter</LOCATION> were fired upon and forced to surrender, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and "preserve the Union," which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, which had repeatedly warned <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>.

The slave states of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> did not secede, and <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas (especially in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>) and held in military prisons without trial. Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, <PERSON>Clement Vallandigham</PERSON>, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte <PERSON>Merryman</PERSON>).

In July 1862, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> moved to free the slaves by passing the Second Confiscation Act. The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the Thirteenth Amendment did that), the Act showed that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> had the support of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in liberating slaves owned by rebels. This new law was implemented with <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s "Emancipation Proclamation."

Ending slavery was always a primary goal of the <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> administration. However, the American public was slow to embrace the idea. In a shrewdly penned letter to <PERSON>Horace Greeley</PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION>The New York Tribune</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> masked his goal of ending slavery by making it subservient to the cause of preserving the union:



The Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate hands (over three million) were freed. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> later said: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper." The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation.

In September 1862, thirteen northern governors met in <LOCATION>Altoona</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, at the Loyal War Governors' Conference to discuss the Proclamation and Union war effort. In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General <PERSON>George B. McClellan</PERSON> as commander of the Union's Army of the <LOCATION>Potomac</LOCATION>.

For some time, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As <PERSON>Frederick Douglass</PERSON> observed, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was, "The first great man that I talked with in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color."

Although the Battle of <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> was a <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> victory, it was also the bloodiest battle of the war and dealt a blow to <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s war effort. As the <ORGANIZATION>Union Army</ORGANIZATION> decreased in numbers due to casualties, more soldiers were needed to replace the ranks. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s 1863 military drafts were considered "odious" among many in the north, particularly immigrants. The <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Draft Riots of July, 1863 were the most notable manifestation of this discontent.

Writing to <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> in September 1863, the Governor of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Andrew Curtin</PERSON>, warned that political sentiments were turning against <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> and the war effort:



At the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, on November 19, beginning with the now-iconic phrase "Four score and seven years ago...", <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> referred to the events of the Civil War and described the ceremony at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> as an opportunity not only to dedicate the grounds of a cemetery, but also to consecrate the living in the struggle to ensure that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth".

After Union victories at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chattanooga</LOCATION> in 1863, overall victory seemed at hand, and <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> promoted <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON> General-in-Chief ( March 12, 1864). When the spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> supported <PERSON>Grant</PERSON>'s strategy of wearing down <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>'s Confederate army at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> selected <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON>, a War Democrat from the Southern state of <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new <ORGANIZATION>Union Party</ORGANIZATION> ticket uniting Republicans and War Democrats.



Nevertheless, Republicans across the country feared that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> would be defeated. Acknowledging this fear, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:



<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.

While the Democratic platform followed the Peace wing of the party and called the war a "failure," their candidate, General <PERSON>George B. McClellan</PERSON>, supported the war and repudiated the platform.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> provided <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> with new replacements and mobilized his party to support <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> and win local support for the war effort. <PERSON>Sherman</PERSON>'s capture of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> in September ended defeatist jitters; the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>; the Union party was united and energized, and <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was easily reelected in a landslide. He won all but two states, capturing 212 of 233 electoral votes.

On March 4, 1865, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> delivered his second inaugural address, his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the rebels was at hand, slavery was dead, and <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was looking to the future.



The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General <PERSON>McClellan</PERSON>, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the <ORGANIZATION>First Battle of Bull Run</ORGANIZATION> and after the retirement of <PERSON>Winfield Scott</PERSON> in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. <PERSON>McClellan</PERSON>, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, with the objective of capturing <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> by moving the Army of the <LOCATION>Potomac</LOCATION> by boat to the peninsula between the <PERSON>James</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>York Rivers</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>McClellan</PERSON>'s delay irritated <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> insisted on holding some of <PERSON>McClellan</PERSON>'s troops to defend the capital, a decision <PERSON>McClellan</PERSON> blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.

<PERSON>McClellan</PERSON>, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON>'s Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> urging caution in the war effort. <PERSON>McClellan</PERSON>'s letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> to appoint <PERSON>John Pope</PERSON>, a Republican, as head of the new Army of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>. Pope complied with <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s strategic desire to move toward <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the <LOCATION>Potomac</LOCATION> to defend <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for a second time. In response to his failure, <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> to fight the <LOCATION>Sioux</LOCATION>.



Panicked by <PERSON>Lee</PERSON>'s invasion of <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> restored <PERSON>McClellan</PERSON> to command of all forces around <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> in time for the Battle of <ORGANIZATION>Antietam</ORGANIZATION> (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved <PERSON>McClellan</PERSON> of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican <PERSON>Ambrose Burnside</PERSON> to head the Army of the <LOCATION>Potomac</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Burnside</PERSON> had promised to follow through on <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s strategic vision for a strong offensive against <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>. After <PERSON>Burnside</PERSON> was stunningly defeated at <LOCATION>Fredericksburg</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Joseph Hooker</PERSON> was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders. <PERSON>Hooker</PERSON> was routed by <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> at the Battle of <LOCATION>Chancellorsville</LOCATION> (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION> Campaign replaced by <PERSON>George Meade</PERSON>.

After the Union victory at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Meade</PERSON>'s failure to pursue <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> and months of inactivity for the Army of the <LOCATION>Potomac</LOCATION> persuaded <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> to bring in a western general, <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>. <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Chattanooga</LOCATION>. Responding to criticism of <PERSON>Grant</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was quoted as saying, "I cannot spare this man. He fights." <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. His invasion campaign eventually bottled <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> up in the Siege of <LOCATION>Petersburg</LOCATION>, so that <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> could take <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, and bring the war to a close in the spring of 1865.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> authorized <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> to target civilians and infrastructure, hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed <PERSON>Generals Sherman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sheridan</PERSON> to destroy farms and towns in the <LOCATION>Shenandoah Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>. The damage caused by <PERSON>Sherman</PERSON>'s March to the Sea through <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> totaled in excess of $100 million by <PERSON>Sherman</PERSON>'s own estimate.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the <LOCATION>Mississippi River</LOCATION> and the fortress city of <LOCATION>Vicksburg</LOCATION>) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>. Only then could he insist on using African American troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.

Throughout the war, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During <PERSON>Jubal Anderson</PERSON> Early's raid on <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> in 1864, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> had to be told to duck to avoid being shot while observing the battle.

Reconstruction began during the war as <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> led the "moderates" regarding Reconstructionist policy, and was usually opposed by the Radical Republicans, under <PERSON>Thaddeus Stevens</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Charles Sumner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Benjamin Wade</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance. Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> appointed <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON> as governor, and <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10% of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis <PERSON>Bill</PERSON>, in 1864. When <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> pocket-vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>.

Near the end of the war, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> made an extended visit to <PERSON>Grant</PERSON>'s headquarters at <LOCATION>City Point</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>. This allowed the president to visit <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> after it was taken by the Union forces and to make a public gesture of sitting at <PERSON>Jefferson Davis</PERSON>'s own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, "I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> and have felt him." When a general asked <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> how the defeated Confederates should be treated, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> replied, "Let 'em up easy." <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> arrived back in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on the evening of April 9, 1865, the day <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> surrendered at <ORGANIZATION>Appomattox Court House</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>. The war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. The <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Address</ORGANIZATION> defied <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s own prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here." His second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted.

In recent years, historians have stressed <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s use of and redefinition of republican values. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> shifted emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism. The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As <PERSON>Diggins</PERSON> concludes regarding the highly influential <ORGANIZATION>Cooper Union</ORGANIZATION> speech, "<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself." His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms. Nevertheless, in 1861 <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a "republican form of government" in every state. That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in Reconstruction.

In his <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Address Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, "that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty. While some critics say <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> moved too far and too fast, they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked "a new founding of the nation."

During the Civil War, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to write the laws while he signed them, vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION>First Transcontinental Railroad</ORGANIZATION>, which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first income tax and higher tariffs. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the National Banking Acts of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> created and <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> approved the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.

The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> Note, the first paper currency in <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> history. This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.

During the war, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied South the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.

In 1862, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> sent a senior general, <PERSON>John Pope</PERSON>, to put down the "Sioux Uprising" in <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>. Presented with 303 death warrants for convicted <LOCATION>Santee Dakota</LOCATION> who had massacred innocent farmers, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved).

Illnesses included: frostbitten feet, malaria, physical trauma and smallpox. Claims that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> had syphilis about 1835 have been controversial, but a recent analysis finds them credible.

As a child, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was tall for his age. He reached his adult height of  no later than age 21. Friends noticed his arms, legs, hands, and feet were long. Although well muscled as a young adult, he was always thin. Fragmentary evidence says he weighed around 170 pounds before the Presidency, but lost weight while in the White House. Based on <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s unusual physical appearance, Dr. <PERSON>Abraham Gordon</PERSON> proposed in 1962 that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> had Marfan syndrome. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s unremarkable cardiovascular history and his normal visual acuity have been the chief objections to the theory, and today the diagnosis is considered unlikely. Testing <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s DNA for Marfan syndrome was contemplated in the 1990s, but such a test was not performed.

In 2007, Dr. <PERSON>John Sotos</PERSON> proposed that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> had multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B (MEN2B). This theory suggests <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> had all the major features of the disease: a marfan-like body shape, large, bumpy lips, constipation, hypotonia, a history compatible with cancer and a family history of the disorder - his sons <PERSON>Eddie</PERSON>, <PERSON>Willie</PERSON>, and Tad, and probably his mother. The "mole" on <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s right cheek, the asymmetry of his face, his large jaw, his drooping eyelid, and "pseudo-depression" are also suggested as manifestations of MEN2B. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s longevity is the principal challenge to the MEN2B theory, which could be proven by DNA testing.



Originally, <PERSON>John Wilkes Booth</PERSON>, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, had formulated a plan to kidnap <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed <PERSON>Booth</PERSON> changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president. Learning that the President and First Lady would be attending <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s Theatre, he laid his plans, assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON>William H. Seward</PERSON>.

Without his main bodyguard <PERSON>Ward Hill Lamon</PERSON>, to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14, 1865. As a lone bodyguard wandered, and <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, <PERSON>Booth</PERSON> crept up behind the President and waited for what he thought would be the funniest line of the play ("You sock-dologizing old man-trap"), hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, <PERSON>Booth</PERSON> jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug 0.44 caliber <PERSON>Henry Deringer</PERSON> at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major <PERSON>Henry Rathbone</PERSON> momentarily grappled with <PERSON>Booth</PERSON> but was cut by <PERSON>Booth</PERSON>'s knife. <PERSON>Booth</PERSON> then leapt to the stage and shouted "Sic semper tyrannis!" () and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap. A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which <PERSON>Booth</PERSON> was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of Secretary of War <PERSON>Edwin M. Stanton</PERSON>). He was eventually cornered in a <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> barn house and shot, dying of his wounds soon after.

An army surgeon, Doctor <PERSON>Charles Leale</PERSON>, initially assessed <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s wound as mortal. The President was taken across the street from the theater to the <LOCATION>Petersen House</LOCATION>, where he lay in a coma for nine hours before dying. Several physicians attended <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>, including <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> Surgeon General <PERSON>Joseph K. Barnes</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Army Medical Museum</ORGANIZATION>. Using a probe, <PERSON>Barnes</PERSON> located some fragments of <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s skull and the ball lodged 6 inches (15 cm) inside his brain. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at 7:22:10 a.m. April 15, 1865. There is some disagreement among historians as to <PERSON>Stanton</PERSON>'s words after <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> died. All agree that he began "Now he belongs to the..." with some stating he said "ages" while others believe he said "angels." After <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s body was returned to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, a brain-only autopsy was performed, and his body was prepared for his lying in repose in the <LOCATION>East Room</LOCATION>. He was the first president to be assassinated or to lie in state.

The <ORGANIZATION>Army Medical Museum</ORGANIZATION>, now named the <ORGANIZATION>National Museum of Health and Medicine</ORGANIZATION>, has retained in its collection several artifacts relating to the assassination. Currently on display are the bullet that was fired from the <ORGANIZATION>Philadelphia Deringer</ORGANIZATION> pistol, the probe used by <PERSON>Barnes</PERSON>, pieces of <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s skull and hair, and the surgeon's cuff stained with <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s blood. The chair in which <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was shot is on display at the <ORGANIZATION>Henry Ford Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>. While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered a tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in <LOCATION>Oak Ridge Cemetery</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>. To prevent repeated attempts to steal <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s body and hold it for ransom, <PERSON>Robert Todd Lincoln</PERSON> had <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick in 1901.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was known for appointing political rivals to high positions in his cabinet to keep in line all factions of his party and to let them battle each other and not combine against him. Historians agree that, except for <PERSON>Simon Cameron</PERSON>, it was a highly effective group.



<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> appointed the following Justices to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>:



In March 1860 in a speech in <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> said, with respect to slavery, Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained." The philosophical basis for Lincolns beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> be examined "seriously as a man of ideas." <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs.

There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincolns moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincolns personal philosophy was shaped by "an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning." It was Lincolns reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic "doctrine of necessity" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> described the effect of this doctrine as "that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control." In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> wrote, "I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it."

As <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son <PERSON>Willie</PERSON> in February 1862 may have caused <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> to look towards religion for answers and solace. After Willies death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:



Lincolns religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> would often use the Declaration of Independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies. In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in <LOCATION>Philadelphia Lincoln</LOCATION> said,



He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the Know Nothings. In claiming that all men were created free, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population.

It was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s death made the President a martyr to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> as among the greatest presidents in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history, often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.

Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights-supporting Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln National Corporation</ORGANIZATION>. The Lincoln automobile is also named after him. The ballistic missile submarine ''<PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>'' (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier ''<PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>'' (CVN-72) were named in his honor. Also, the Liberty ship SS <PERSON>Nancy Hanks</PERSON> was named for his mother. During the Spanish Civil War, the American faction of the International Brigades named themselves the <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln Brigade</PERSON>.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, is the only city to be named for <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> before he became President. <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s name and image appear in numerous places. These include the Lincoln Memorial in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> $5 bill and the <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> cent, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s sculpture on the <LOCATION>Mount Rushmore</LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Home National Historic Site</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>. In addition, <LOCATION>New Salem</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> (a reconstruction of <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s early adult hometown), <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s Theatre, and <ORGANIZATION>Petersen House</ORGANIZATION> (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in <LOCATION>Redlands</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, is located behind the <ORGANIZATION>A.K. Smiley Public Library</ORGANIZATION>. The state nickname for <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> is Land of <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>.

Counties in 18 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> states (<LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION>) are named after <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>.

<PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>'s birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as Presidents' Day. However, it is still observed in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and many other states as a separate legal holiday, <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s Birthday. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as 'Presidents' Day' as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.

To commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> established the <ORGANIZATION>Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>ALBC</ORGANIZATION>) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincolns legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an advisory board of over 130 various <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> historians and enthusiasts. Located at Library of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>ALBC</ORGANIZATION> is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincolns birthplace: <LOCATION>Hodgenville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> Birthplace National Historic Site in <LOCATION>Hodgenville</LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln Home National Historic Site</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>. The <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> Presidential Library and Museum opened in <LOCATION>Springfield</LOCATION> in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits.

<TITLE><PERSON>

<PERSON>Ernest Miller Hemingway</PERSON> (July 21, 1899 July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer, and journalist. He was part of the 1920s expatriate community in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, and one of the veterans of World War I later known as "the Lost Generation." He received the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 for The Old Man and the Sea, and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s distinctive writing style is characterized by economy and understatement, and had a significant influence on the development of twentieth-century fiction writing. His protagonists are typically stoical men who exhibit an ideal described as "grace under pressure." Many of his works are now considered classics of American literature.

<PERSON>Ernest Miller Hemingway</PERSON> was born on July 21, 1899 in <LOCATION>Oak Park</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> was the first son and the second child born to <PERSON>Clarence Edmonds</PERSON> "Doc Ed" <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> - a country doctor, and <PERSON>Grace Hall Hemingway</PERSON>. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s father attended the birth of <PERSON>Ernest</PERSON> and blew a horn on his front porch to announce to the neighbors that his wife had given birth to a boy. The <ORGANIZATION>Hemingways</ORGANIZATION> lived in a six-bedroom Victorian house built by <PERSON>Ernest</PERSON>'s widowed maternal grandfather, <PERSON>Ernest Miller Hall</PERSON>, an English immigrant and Civil War veteran who lived with the family. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> was his namesake. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s mother once aspired to an opera career and earned money giving voice and music lessons. She was domineering and narrowly religious, mirroring the strict Protestant ethic of <LOCATION>Oak Park</LOCATION>, which <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> later said had "wide lawns and narrow minds". While his mother hoped that her son would develop an interest in music, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> adopted his father's outdoorsman hobbies of hunting, fishing and camping in the woods and lakes of <LOCATION>Northern Michigan</LOCATION>. The family owned a summer home called <LOCATION>Windemere</LOCATION> on <LOCATION>Walloon Lake</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Petoskey</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and often spent summers vacationing there. These early experiences in close contact with nature instilled in <LOCATION>Hemingway</LOCATION> a lifelong passion for outdoor adventure and for living in remote or isolated areas.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> attended <LOCATION>Oak Park</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>River Forest High School</ORGANIZATION> from September 1913 until graduation in June 1917. He excelled both academically and athletically; he boxed, played American football, and displayed particular talent in English classes. His first writing experience was writing for "Trapeze" and "Tabula" (the school's newspaper and yearbook, respectively) in his junior year, then serving as editor in his senior year. He sometimes wrote under the pen name <PERSON>Ring Lardner</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jr.</PERSON>, a nod to his literary hero <PERSON>Ring Lardner</PERSON>.

After high school, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> did not want to go to college. Instead, at age eighteen, he began his writing career as a cub reporter for The <ORGANIZATION>Kansas City Star</ORGANIZATION>. Although he worked at the newspaper for only six months (October 17, 1917-April 30, 1918), throughout his lifetime he used the guidance of the Star's style guide as a foundation for his writing style: "Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative." In honor of the centennial year of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s birth (1899), The Star named <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> its top reporter of the last hundred years.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> left his reporting job after only a few months and, against his father's wishes, tried to join the <ORGANIZATION>United States Army</ORGANIZATION> to see action in World War I. He failed the medical examination due to poor vision, and instead joined the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross Ambulance Corps</ORGANIZATION>. On his route to the Italian front, he stopped in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, which was under constant bombardment from German artillery. Instead of staying in the relative safety of the <LOCATION>Hotel Florida</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> tried to get as close to combat as possible.Soon after arriving on the Italian Front <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> witnessed the brutalities of war. On his first day on duty an ammunition factory near <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> blew up. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> had to pick up the humanprimarily femaleremains. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> wrote about this experience in his short story "A Natural History of the Dead". This first encounter with death left him shaken.

The soldiers he met later did not lighten the horror. One of them, <PERSON>Eric Dorman-Smith</PERSON>, entertained <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> with a line from Part Two of <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON>'s ''<PERSON>Henry</PERSON> IV'', <PERSON>Act III</PERSON>, Scene II: "By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God a death...and let it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next." (<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>, for his part, would quote this line in "The Short Happy Life of <PERSON>Francis Macomber</PERSON>", one of his famous short stories set in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>.) To another soldier, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> once said, "You are troppo vecchio (It. too old) for this war, pop." The 50-year old soldier replied, "I can die as well as any man."

On July 8, 1918, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> was wounded delivering supplies to soldiers, which ended his career as an ambulance driver. He was hit by an Austrian trench mortar shell that left fragments in his legs, and was also hit by a burst of machine-gun fire. He was later awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor (medaglia d'argento) from the Italian government for dragging a wounded Italian soldier to safety in spite of his own injuries. He was credited as the first American wounded in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> during WWI by newspapers at the time but there is debate surrounding the veracity of this claim.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> received treatment in a <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> hospital run by the <ORGANIZATION>American Red Cross</ORGANIZATION>. With very little in the way of entertainment, he often drank heavily and read newspapers to pass the time. Here he met <PERSON>Agnes von Kurowsky</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, one of eighteen nurses attending groups of four patients each, who was more than six years his senior. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> fell in love with her, but their relationship did not survive his return to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>; instead of following <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, as originally planned, she became romantically involved with an Italian officer. This left an indelible mark on his psyche and provided inspiration for, and was fictionalized in, one of his early novels, A Farewell to Arms. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s first story based on this relationship, "A Very Short Story," appeared in 1925. 

After the war, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Oak Park</LOCATION>, and in 1920, he moved to an apartment on 1599 <LOCATION>Bathurst Street</LOCATION>, now known as The <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>, in the Humewood-Cedarvale neighborhood in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ontario</LOCATION>. During his stay, he found a job with the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Star</ORGANIZATION> newspaper. He worked as a freelancer, staff writer, and foreign correspondent. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> befriended fellow Star reporter <PERSON>Morley Callaghan</PERSON>. <PERSON>Callaghan</PERSON> had begun writing short stories at this time; he showed them to <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>, who praised them as fine work. They would later be reunited in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.

For a short time from late 1920 through most of 1921, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> lived on the near north side of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, while still filing stories for <ORGANIZATION>The Toronto Star</ORGANIZATION>. He also worked as associate editor of the Co-operative <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION>, a monthly journal. On September 3, 1921, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> married his first wife, <PERSON>Hadley Richardson</PERSON>. After the honeymoon they moved to a cramped top floor apartment on the 1300 block of <LOCATION>Clark Street</LOCATION>. In September, they moved to a cramped fourth floor apartment (3rd floor by <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> building standard) at 1239 <LOCATION>North Dearborn</LOCATION> in a then run-down section of <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>'s near north side. The building still stands with a plaque on the front of it calling it "The Hemingway Apartment." <PERSON>Hadley</PERSON> found it dark and depressing, but in December, 1921, the <ORGANIZATION>Hemingways</ORGANIZATION> left <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Oak Park</LOCATION>, never to live there again, and moved abroad.

On the advice of <PERSON>Sherwood Anderson</PERSON>, they settled in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> covered the Greco-Turkish War for the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Star</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> gave him a letter of introduction to <PERSON>Gertrude Stein</PERSON>. She became his mentor and introduced him to the "Parisian Modern Movement" then ongoing in the <LOCATION>Montparnasse</LOCATION> Quarter; this was the beginning of the American expatriate circle that became known as the "Lost Generation", a term popularized by <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> in the epigraph to his novel, The Sun Also Rises, and his memoir, A Moveable Feast. The epithet, "Lost Generation" was reportedly appropriated by Miss <PERSON>Stein</PERSON> from her French garage mechanic when he made the offhand comment that hers was "une gnration perdue". ("'That's what you are. That's what you all are,' Miss <PERSON>Stein</PERSON> said. 'All of you young people who served in the war. You are a lost generation.'" -- from <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s posthumous memoir, A Moveable Feast.) His other influential mentor was Ezra Pound, the founder of imagism. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> later said of this eclectic group, "<PERSON>Ezra</PERSON> was right half the time, and when he was wrong, he was so wrong you were never in any doubt about it. <PERSON>Gertrude</PERSON> was always right." The group often frequented <PERSON>Sylvia Beach</PERSON>'s bookshop, <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare & Co.</ORGANIZATION>, at 12 Rue de l'Odon. After the 1922 publication and American banning of colleague <PERSON>James Joyce</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> used Toronto-based friends to smuggle copies of the novel into the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Hemingway</ORGANIZATION> writes of meeting and talking with <PERSON>Joyce</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in A Movable Feast). His own first book, called Three Stories and Ten Poems (1923), was published in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Robert McAlmon</PERSON>.

After much success as a foreign correspondent, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> in 1923 writing under the pseudonym of <PERSON>Peter Jackson</PERSON>. During his second stint living in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s first son was born. He was named <PERSON>John Hadley Nicanor Hemingway</PERSON>, but would later be known as <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Gertrude Stein</PERSON> to be <PERSON>Jack</PERSON>'s godmother.

Around the same time, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> had a bitter falling out with his editor, <PERSON>Harry Hindmarsh</PERSON>, who believed <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> had been spoiled by his time overseas. <PERSON>Hindmarsh</PERSON> gave <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> mundane assignments, and <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> grew bitter and wrote an angry resignation in December 1923. However, his resignation was either ignored or rescinded, and <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> continued to write sporadically for <ORGANIZATION>The Toronto Star</ORGANIZATION> through 1924. Most of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s work for the Star was later published in the 1985 collection .

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s American literary debut came with the publication of the short story cycle In Our Time (1925). The vignettes that now constitute the interchapters of the American version were initially published in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> as in our time (1924). This work was important for <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>, reaffirming to him that his minimalist style could be accepted by the literary community. "Big Two-Hearted River" is the collection's best-known story.

In April 1925, two weeks after the publication of The Great Gatsby, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> met <PERSON>F. Scott Fitzgerald</PERSON> at the Dingo Bar. <PERSON>Fitzgerald</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> were at first close friends, often drinking and talking together. They sometimes exchanged manuscripts, and <PERSON>Fitzgerald</PERSON> did much to try to advance <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s career and the publication of his first collections of stories.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s relationships in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> provided inspiration for <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s first full-length novel, The Sun Also Rises (1926) (published in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> under the title "Fiesta"). The novel was semi-autobiographical, following a group of expatriate Americans around <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. The climactic scenes of the novel are set in <LOCATION>Pamplona</LOCATION>, during the fiesta that the novel made famous throughout <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>. The novel was a success and met with critical acclaim. While <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> had initially claimed that the novel was an obsolete form of literature, he was apparently inspired to write it after reading <PERSON>Fitzgerald</PERSON>'s manuscript for The Great Gatsby.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> divorced <PERSON>Hadley Richardson</PERSON> in 1927 and married <PERSON>Pauline Pfeiffer</PERSON>, a devout <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic</ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON>Piggott</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Pfeiffer</PERSON> was an occasional fashion reporter, publishing in magazines such as Vanity Fair and Vogue. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> converted to Catholicism himself at this time. That year saw the publication of Men Without Women, a collection of short stories, containing The Killers, one of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s best-known and most-anthologized stories. In 1928, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pfeiffer</PERSON> moved to <LOCATION>Key West</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, to begin their new life together. However, their new life was soon interrupted by yet another tragic event in <LOCATION>Hemingway</LOCATION>'s life.

In 1928, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s father, <PERSON>Clarence</PERSON>, troubled with diabetes and financial instabilities, committed suicide using an old Civil War pistol. This greatly hurt <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> and is perhaps played out through <PERSON>Robert Jordan</PERSON>'s father's suicide in the novel For Whom the <ORGANIZATION>Bell Tolls</ORGANIZATION>. He immediately traveled to <LOCATION>Oak Park</LOCATION> to arrange the funeral and stirred up controversy by vocalizing what he thought to be the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic</ORGANIZATION> view, that suicides go to hell. At about the same time, <PERSON>Harry Crosby</PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Black Sun Press</ORGANIZATION> and a friend of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s from his days in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, also committed suicide. In that same year, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s second son, <PERSON>Patrick</PERSON>, was born in <LOCATION>Kansas City</LOCATION> (his third son, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON>, would be born to the couple a few years later). It was a Caesarean birth after difficult labor, details of which were incorporated into the concluding scene of A Farewell to Arms. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> lived and wrote most of A Farewell to Arms plus several short stories at <PERSON>Pauline</PERSON>'s parents' house in <LOCATION>Piggott</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION>Pfeiffer House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Carriage House</ORGANIZATION> has since been converted into a museum owned by <ORGANIZATION>Arkansas State University</ORGANIZATION>.

Published in 1929, A Farewell to Arms recounts the romance between <PERSON>Frederic Henry</PERSON>, an American soldier, and <PERSON>Catherine Barkley</PERSON>, a British nurse. The novel is heavily autobiographical: the plot was directly inspired by his relationship with <PERSON>Agnes von Kurowsky</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>; <PERSON>Catherine</PERSON>'s parturition was inspired by the intense labor pains of <PERSON>Pauline</PERSON> in the birth of <LOCATION>Patrick</LOCATION>; the real-life <PERSON>Kitty Cannell</PERSON> inspired the fictional <PERSON>Helen Ferguson</PERSON>; the priest was based on <PERSON>Don Giuseppe Bianchi</PERSON>, the priest of the 69th and 70th regiments of the <LOCATION>Brigata Ancona</LOCATION>. While the inspiration of the character <PERSON>Rinaldi</PERSON> is obscure, he had already appeared in In Our Time. A Farewell to Arms was published at a time when many other World War I books were prominent, including <PERSON>Frederic Manning</PERSON>'s Her Privates We, <PERSON>Erich Maria Remarque</PERSON>'s All Quiet on the <ORGANIZATION>Western Front</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Richard Aldington</PERSON>'s Death of a Hero, and <PERSON>Robert Graves</PERSON>' Goodbye to All That. The success of A Farewell to Arms made <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> financially independent.

Following the advice of <PERSON>John Dos Passos</PERSON>, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Key West</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> in 1931, where he established his first <LOCATION>American</LOCATION> home, which has since been converted to a museum. From this 1851 solid limestone house -- a wedding present from <PERSON>Pauline</PERSON>'s uncle -- <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> fished in the waters around the Dry Tortugas with his longtime friend <PERSON>Waldo Pierce</PERSON>, went to the famous bar Sloppy <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>'s, and occasionally traveled to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, gathering material for Death in the Afternoon and Winner Take Nothing. Over the next 9 years, until the end of this marriage in 1940, and then in a second period throughout the 1950s, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> would do an estimated 70% of his lifetime's writing in the writer's den in the upper floor of the converted garage, in back of this house.

Death in the Afternoon, a book about bullfighting, was published in 1932. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> had become an aficionado after seeing the <LOCATION>Pamplona</LOCATION> fiesta of 1925, fictionalized in The Sun Also Rises. In Death in the Afternoon, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> extensively discussed the metaphysics of bullfighting: the ritualized, almost religious practice. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> considered becoming a bullfighter himself and showed middling aptitude in several novieros before deciding that writing was his true and only suitable professional metier. In his writings on <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, he was influenced by the Spanish master <PERSON>Po Baroja</PERSON>. When <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> won the Nobel Prize, he traveled to see <PERSON>Baroja</PERSON>, then on his death bed, specifically to tell him he thought <PERSON>Baroja</PERSON> deserved the prize more than he. <PERSON>Baroja</PERSON> agreed and something of the usual <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> tiff with another writer ensued despite his original good intentions.

A safari in the fall of 1933 led him to <LOCATION>Mombasa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Machakos</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION>, moving on to <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION>, where he hunted in the <LOCATION>Serengeti</LOCATION>, around <LOCATION>Lake Manyara</LOCATION> and west and southeast of the present-day <LOCATION>Tarangire National Park</LOCATION>. 1935 saw the publication of <LOCATION>Green Hills of Africa</LOCATION>, an account of his safari. The Snows of Kilimano and The Short Happy Life of <PERSON>Francis Macomber</PERSON> were the fictionalized results of his African experiences. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> fell ill on this trip, suffering a prolapsed intestine.

In 1937, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> in order to report on the Spanish Civil War for the <ORGANIZATION>North American Newspaper Alliance</ORGANIZATION>. While there, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> broke his friendship with <PERSON>John Dos Passos</PERSON> because, despite warnings, <PERSON>Dos Passos</PERSON> continued to report on the atrocities of not only the fascist Nationalists whom <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> disliked, but also those of the elected and radicalized left-leaning Republicans whom he favored; characteristically, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> spread a story that <PERSON>Dos Passos</PERSON> had fled <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> out of cowardice. In this context <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s colleague and associate <PERSON>Herbert Matthews</PERSON>, who would become more well known for his favorable reports on <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON>, showed a similar predilection for the Republican side as <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>, who was a convert to Catholicism during his marriage to his wife <PERSON>Pauline</PERSON>, began to question his religion at this time, eventually leaving the church (though friends indicate that he had "funny ties" to Catholicism for the rest of his life). The war also strained <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s marriage. <PERSON>Pauline Pfieffer</PERSON> was a devout <ORGANIZATION>Catholic</ORGANIZATION> and, as such, sided with the fascist, pro-Catholic regime of Franco, whereas <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> mostly supported the Republican government, for all his criticisms of it. During this time, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> wrote a little known essay, The Denunciation, which would not be published until 1969 within a collection of stories, the Fifth Column and Four Stories of the Spanish Civil War. The story seems autobiographical, suggesting that <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> might have been an informant for the Republic as well as a weapons instructor during the war.

Some health problems characterized this period of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s life: an anthrax infection, a cut eyeball, a gash in his forehead, grippe, toothache, hemorrhoids, kidney trouble from fishing, torn groin muscle, finger gashed to the bone in an accident with a punching ball, lacerations (to arms, legs, and face) from a ride on a runaway horse through a deep <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> forest, and a broken arm from a car accident.

In 1938--along with his only full-length play, titled The Fifth Column--49 stories were published in the collection The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s intention was, as he openly stated in his foreword, to write more. Many of the stories that make up this collection can be found in other abridged collections, including In Our Time, Men Without Women, Winner Take Nothing, and The Snows of <LOCATION>Kilimanjaro</LOCATION>.

Some of the collection's important stories include Old Man at the Bridge, On The Quai at <LOCATION>Smyrna</LOCATION>, Hills Like White Elephants, One Reader Writes, The Killers and (perhaps most famously) A Clean, Well-Lighted Place. While these stories are rather short, the book also includes much longer stories, among them The Snows of Kilimanjaro and The Short Happy Life of <PERSON>Francis Macomber</PERSON>.

In the spring of 1939, <PERSON>Francisco Franco</PERSON> and the Nationalists defeated the Republicans, ending the Spanish Civil War. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> lost an adopted homeland to <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>'s fascists, and would later lose his beloved Key West, <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, home due to his 1940 divorce. 

A few weeks after the divorce, he married his companion of four years in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Martha Gellhorn</PERSON>, his third wife. 

His novel For Whom the <ORGANIZATION>Bell Tolls</ORGANIZATION> was published in 1940. It was written in 1939 in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and Key West, and was finished in July 1940. The long work, which is set during the Spanish Civil War, was based on real events and tells of an American named <PERSON>Robert Jordan</PERSON> fighting with <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> soldiers on the Republican side. It was largely based on <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s experience of living in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and reporting on the war. It is one of his most notable literary accomplishments. The title is taken from the penultimate paragraph of <PERSON>John Donne</PERSON>'s Meditation XVII.

The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> entered World War II on December 8, 1941, and for the first time in his life, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> sought to take part in naval warfare. Aboard the <PERSON>Pilar</PERSON>, now a Q-Ship, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s crew was charged with sinking German submarines threatening shipping off the coasts of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. After the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> took over <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> counter-espionage, he went to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> as a war correspondent for <PERSON>Collier</PERSON>'s magazine. There <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> observed the D-Day landings from an LCVP (landing craft), although he was not allowed to go ashore. He later became angry that his wife, <PERSON>Martha Gellhorn</PERSON> -- by then, more a rival war correspondent than a wife -- had managed to get ashore in the early hours of June 7 dressed as a nurse, after she had crossed the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> in a ship loaded with explosives. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> acted as an unofficial liaison officer at Chteau de Rambouillet, and afterwards formed his own partisan group which, as he later wrote, took part in the liberation of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.  Although this claim has been challenged by many historians, he was nevertheless unquestionably on the scene. It has also been purported that while traveling to the front he threw a hand grenade into a basement room full of German field grade officers despite his official non-combatant role. 

After the war, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> started work on The Garden of Eden, which was never finished and would be published posthumously in a much-abridged form in 1986. At one stage, he planned a major trilogy which was to comprise "The Sea When Young", "The Sea When Absent" and "The Sea in Being" (the latter eventually published in 1952 as The Old Man and the Sea). He spent time in a small Italian town called <LOCATION>Acciaroli</LOCATION> (located approximately 136 km south of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>). There was also a "Sea-Chase" story; three of these pieces were edited and stuck together as the posthumously-published novel Islands in the Stream (1970).

Newly divorced from <PERSON>Gellhorn</PERSON> after four contentious years, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> married war correspondent <PERSON>Mary Welsh Hemingway</PERSON>, whom he had met overseas in 1944. He returned to <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, and in 1945 at the <ORGANIZATION>Soviet Embassy</ORGANIZATION> became public witness to the <PERSON>Rolando Masferrer</PERSON> schism within the <LOCATION>Cuban</LOCATION> communist party (<PERSON>Garca Montes</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Alonso</PERSON> vila, 1970 p. 362).

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s first novel after For Whom the <ORGANIZATION>Bell Tolls</ORGANIZATION> was Across the River and into the Trees (1950), set in post-World War II <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION>. He derived the title from the last words of American Civil War Confederate General <PERSON>Stonewall Jackson</PERSON>. Enamored of a young Italian girl (<PERSON>Adriana Ivancich</PERSON>) at the time, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> wrote Across the River and into the Trees as a romance between a war-weary Colonel <PERSON>Cantwell</PERSON> (based on his friend, then Colonel <PERSON>Charles Lanham</PERSON>) and the young <PERSON>Renata</PERSON> (clearly based on <PERSON>Adriana</PERSON>; "Renata" has an assonance with "rinata", meaning "reborn" in Italian). The novel received largely bad reviews, many of which accused <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> of tastelessness, stylistic ineptitude, and sentimentality; however this criticism was not shared by all critics.

One section of the sea trilogy was published as The Old Man and the Sea in 1952. That novella's great success, both commercial and critical, satisfied and fulfilled <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>. It earned him the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. The next year he was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Literature. Upon receiving the latter he noted that he would have been "happy; happier...if the prize had been given to that beautiful writer <PERSON>Isak Dinesen</PERSON>". These awards helped to restore his international reputation.

Then, his legendary bad luck struck once again; on a safari, he was seriously injured in two successive plane crashes; he sprained his right shoulder, arm, and left leg, had a grave concussion, temporarily lost vision in his left eye and the hearing in his left ear, suffered paralysis of the spine, a crushed vertebra, ruptured liver, spleen and kidney, and first degree burns on his face, arms, and leg. Some American newspapers mistakenly published his obituary, thinking he had been killed.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> was then badly injured one month later in a bushfire accident, which left him with second degree burns on his legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm. The pain left him in prolonged anguish, and he was unable to travel to <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION> to accept his Nobel Prize.

A glimmer of hope came with the discovery of some of his old manuscripts from 1928 in the Ritz cellars, which were transformed into A Moveable Feast. Although some of his energy seemed to be restored, severe drinking problems kept him down. His blood pressure and cholesterol were perilously high, he suffered from aortal inflammation, and his depression was aggravated by his dipsomania. However, in October 1956, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> found the strength to travel to <LOCATION>Madrid</LOCATION> and act as a pallbearer at <PERSON>Po Baroja</PERSON>'s burial. <PERSON>Baroja</PERSON> was one of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s literary influences.

Following the revolution in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and the ousting of General <PERSON>Fulgencio Batista</PERSON> in 1959, expropriations of foreign owned property led many Americans to return to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> chose to stay a little longer. It is commonly said that he maintained good relations with <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON> and declared his support for the revolution, and he is quoted as wishing <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> "all luck" with running the country. However, the <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> account "The Shot" is used by <PERSON>Cabrera Infante</PERSON> and others as evidence of conflict between <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fidel Castro</PERSON> dating back to 1948 and the killing of "Manolo" <PERSON>Castro</PERSON>, a friend of <LOCATION>Hemingway</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> came under surveillance by the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> both during World War II and afterwards (most probably because of his long association with marxist Spanish Civil War veterans who were again active in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>) for his residence and activities in <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>. In 1960, he left the island and <PERSON>Finca Viga</PERSON>, his estate outside <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>, that he owned for over twenty years. The official <LOCATION>Cuban</LOCATION> government account is that it was left to the <LOCATION>Cuban</LOCATION> government, which has made it into a museum devoted to the author. In 2001, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>'s state-owned tourism conglomerate, <PERSON>El Gran-Caribe</PERSON> SA, began licensing the <ORGANIZATION>La Bodeguita del Medio</ORGANIZATION> international restaurant chain relying largely on the original <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION> restaurant's association with <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>, a frequent visitor.

In February 1960, <PERSON>Ernest Hemingway</PERSON> was unable to get his bullfighting narrative The Dangerous Summer to the publishers. He therefore had his wife <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> summon his friend, <ORGANIZATION>Life Magazine</ORGANIZATION> bureau head <PERSON>Will Lang Jr.</PERSON>, to leave <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and come to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> persuaded <PERSON>Lang</PERSON> to let him print the manuscript, along with a picture layout, before it came out in hardcover. Although not a word of it was on paper, the proposal was agreed upon. The first part of the story appeared in <ORGANIZATION>Life Magazine</ORGANIZATION> on September 5, 1960, with the remaining installments being printed in successive issues.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> was upset by the photographs in his The Dangerous Summer article. He was receiving treatment in <LOCATION>Ketchum</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> for high blood pressure and liver problems -- and also electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for depression and continued paranoia, although this may in fact have helped to precipitate his suicide, since he reportedly suffered significant memory loss as a result of the shock treatments. He also lost weight, his 6-foot (183 cm) frame appearing gaunt at 170 pounds (77 kg, 12st 2lb).

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> attempted suicide in the spring of 1961, and received <ORGANIZATION>ECT</ORGANIZATION> treatment again. On the morning of July 2, 1961, some three weeks short of his 62nd birthday, he died at his home in <LOCATION>Ketchum</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, the result of a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head. Judged not mentally responsible for his final act, he was buried in a Roman Catholic service. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> himself blamed the <ORGANIZATION>ECT</ORGANIZATION> treatments for "putting him out of business" by destroying his memory; some medical and scholarly opinion has been receptive to this view, although others, including one of the physicians who prescribed the electroshock regimen, dispute that opinion.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> is believed to have purchased the <ORGANIZATION>Boss & Co.</ORGANIZATION> shotgun he used to commit suicide through <ORGANIZATION>Abercrombie & Fitch</ORGANIZATION>, which was then an elite excursion goods retailer and firearm supplier. In a particularly gruesome suicide, he rested the gun butt of the double-barreled shotgun on the floor of a hallway in his home, leaned over it to put the twin muzzles to his forehead just above the eyes, and pulled both triggers. The coroner, at request of the family, did not do an autopsy.

Other members of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s immediate family also committed suicide, including his father, <PERSON>Clarence Hemingway</PERSON>, his siblings <PERSON>Ursula</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Leicester</LOCATION>, and possibly his granddaughter <PERSON>Margaux Hemingway</PERSON>. Some believe that certain members of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s paternal line had a hereditary disease known as haemochromatosis (bronze diabetes), in which an excess of iron concentration in the blood causes damage to the pancreas and also causes depression or instability in the cerebrum. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s father is known to have developed haemochromatosis in the years prior to his suicide at age fifty-nine. Throughout his life, <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> had been a heavy drinker, succumbing to alcoholism in his later years.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> possibly suffered from manic depression, and was subsequently treated with electroshock therapy at <ORGANIZATION>Menninger Clinic</ORGANIZATION>. He later blamed his memory loss, which he cited as a reason for not wanting to live, upon the ECT sessions.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> is interred in the town cemetery in <LOCATION>Ketchum</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION>, at the north end of town. A memorial was erected in 1966 at another location, overlooking <LOCATION>Trail Creek</LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION>Ketchum</LOCATION>. It is inscribed with a eulogy he wrote for a friend, Gene Van Guilder:



Best of all he loved the fallThe leaves yellow on the cottonwoodsLeaves floating on the trout streamsAnd above the hillsThe high blue windless skiesNow he will be a part of them forever

<PERSON>Ernest Hemingway</PERSON> - <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> - 1939

Celebrating <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s love for <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and the frontier, The Ernest Hemingway Festival takes place annually in <LOCATION>Ketchum</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sun Valley</LOCATION> in late September with scholars, a reading by the PEN/Hemingway Award winner and many more events, including historical tours, open mic nights and a sponsored dinner at <LOCATION>Hemingway</LOCATION>'s home in Warm Springs now maintained by the Nature Conservancy in <LOCATION>Ketchum</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> was a prolific letter writer and, in 1981, many of these were published by Scribner in <PERSON>Ernest Hemingway</PERSON> Selected Letters. It was met with some controversy as <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> himself stated he never wished to publish his letters. Further letters were published in a book of his correspondence with his editor <PERSON>Max Perkins</PERSON>, The Only Thing that Counts [1996].

A long-term project is now underway to publish the thousands of letters <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> wrote during his lifetime. The project is being undertaken as a joint venture by <ORGANIZATION>Penn State University</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Ernest Hemingway Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Sandra Spanier</PERSON>, Professor of English and wife of <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON>Graham Spanier</PERSON>, is serving as general editor of the collection.

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> was still writing up to his death; most of the unfinished works which were <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s sole creation have been published posthumously; they are A Moveable Feast, Islands in the Stream, The Nick Adams Stories (portions of which were previously unpublished), The Dangerous Summer, and The Garden of Eden. In a note forwarding "Islands in the Stream", <PERSON>Mary Hemingway</PERSON> indicated that she worked with <PERSON>Charles Scribner, Jr.</PERSON> on "preparing this book for publication from <PERSON>Ernest</PERSON>'s original manuscript". She also stated that "beyond the routine chores of correcting spelling and punctuation, we made some cuts in the manuscript, I feel that <PERSON>Ernest</PERSON> would surely have made them himself. The book is all Ernest's. We have added nothing to it." Some controversy has surrounded the publication of these works, insofar as it has been suggested that it is not necessarily within the jurisdiction of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s relatives or publishers to determine whether these works should be made available to the public. For example, scholars often disapprovingly note that the version of The Garden of Eden published by <PERSON>Charles Scribner</PERSON>'s Sons in 1986, though in no way a revision of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s original words, nonetheless omits two-thirds of the original manuscript.

The <PERSON>Nick Adams</PERSON> Stories appeared posthumously in 1972. What is now considered the definitive compilation of all of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s short stories was published as The Complete Short Stories Of <PERSON>Ernest Hemingway</PERSON>, first compiled and published in 1987. As well, in 1969 The Fifth Column and Four Stories Of The Spanish Civil War was published. It contains <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s only full length play, The Fifth Column, which was previously published along with the <ORGANIZATION>First Forty-Nine Stories</ORGANIZATION> in 1938, along with four unpublished works written about <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s experiences during the Spanish Civil War.

In 1999, another novel entitled True at First Light appeared under the name of <PERSON>Ernest Hemingway</PERSON>, though it was heavily edited by his son <PERSON>Patrick Hemingway</PERSON>. Six years later, Under Kilimanjaro, a re-edited and considerably longer version of True at First Light appeared. In either edition, the novel is a fictional account of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s final African safari in 19531954. He spent several months in <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> with his fourth wife, <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>, before his near-fatal plane crashes. Anticipation of the novel, whose manuscript was completed in 1956, adumbrates perhaps an unprecedentedly large critical battle over whether it is proper to publish the work (many sources mention that a new, light side of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> will be seen as opposed to his canonical, macho image), even as editors <PERSON>Robert W. Lewis</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>University of North Dakota</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Robert E. Fleming</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>University of New Mexico</ORGANIZATION> have pushed it through to publication; the novel was published on September 15, 2005.

Also published posthumously were several collections of his work as a journalist. These contain his columns and articles for <ORGANIZATION>Esquire Magazine</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>The North American Newspaper Alliance</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Star</ORGANIZATION>; they include Byline: <PERSON>Ernest Hemingway</PERSON> edited by <PERSON>William White</PERSON>, and Hemingway: The Wild Years edited by <PERSON>Gene Z. Hanrahan</PERSON>. Finally, a collection of introductions, forwards, public letters and other miscellanea was published as <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> and the Mechanism of Fame in 2005.

The influence of <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s writings on American literature was considerable and continues today. <PERSON>James Joyce</PERSON> called "A Clean, Well Lighted Place" "one of the best stories ever written". (The same story also influenced several of <PERSON>Edward Hopper</PERSON>'s best known paintings, most notably "Nighthawks." ) Pulp fiction and "hard boiled" crime fiction (which flourished from the 1920s to the 1950s) often owed a strong debt to <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>. 

During World War II, <PERSON>J. D. Salinger</PERSON> met and corresponded with <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>, whom he acknowledged as an influence. In one letter to <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>, <PERSON>Salinger</PERSON> wrote that their talks "had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war," and jokingly "named himself national chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Hemingway Fan Clubs</ORGANIZATION>." 

<PERSON>Hunter S. Thompson</PERSON> often compared himself to <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>, and terse Hemingway-esque sentences can be found in his early novel, The Rum Diary. <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON>'s later suicide by gunshot to the head mirrored <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s. 

<PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s terse prose style--"<PERSON>Nick</PERSON> stood up. He was all right."-- is known to have inspired <PERSON>Charles Bukowski</PERSON>, <PERSON>Chuck Palahniuk</PERSON>, <PERSON>Douglas Coupland</PERSON> and many Generation X writers. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>'s style also influenced <PERSON>Jack Kerouac</PERSON> and other Beat Generation writers. <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> also provided a role model to fellow author and hunter <PERSON>Robert Ruark</PERSON>, who is frequently referred to as "the poor man's <PERSON>Ernest Hemingway</PERSON>". 

Popular novelist <PERSON>Elmore Leonard</PERSON>, who has authored scores of western- and crime-genre novels, cites <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> as his preeminent influence, and this is evident in his tightly written prose. Though <PERSON>Leonard</PERSON> has never claimed to write serious literature, he has said: "I learned by imitating Hemingway.... until I realized that I didn't share his attitude about life. I didn't take myself or anything as seriously as he did."

During his lifetime <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON> was awarded:

A minor planet, discovered in 1978 by <LOCATION>Soviet</LOCATION> astronomer <PERSON>Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh</PERSON>, was named for him3656 <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>.

On July 17, 1989, the <ORGANIZATION>United States Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> issued a 25-cent postage stamp honoring <PERSON>Hemingway</PERSON>.

<TITLE><PERSON>Colin Powell</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>Colin Luther Powell</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>KCB</ORGANIZATION> (Honorary), <ORGANIZATION>MSC</ORGANIZATION>, (born April 5, 1937) is a retired General in the <ORGANIZATION>United States Army</ORGANIZATION>. He was the 65th <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> Secretary of State (2001-2005), serving under President <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON>. He was the first African American appointed to that position. As a General in the <ORGANIZATION>United States Army</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> also served as National Security Advisor (19871989) and as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (19891993), holding the latter position during the Gulf War. He was the first and, so far, the only African American to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Harlem</LOCATION>, a neighborhood in the <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> in 1937 to Jamaican immigrant parents and was raised in the <LOCATION>South Bronx</LOCATION>. He also has Scottish, and other ancestries. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION>Morris High School</ORGANIZATION>, a former public school in <LOCATION>The Bronx</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, from which he graduated in 1954. While in school, he worked a local shop where he picked up Yiddish from the shopkeepers and some of the customers. He remembers some of his Yiddish to this day. He gained a bachelor's degree in geology from <ORGANIZATION>City College</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> attaining a "C" average, according to his 2006 graduation address at <ORGANIZATION>Marymount University</ORGANIZATION>. He later obtained an MBA from The <ORGANIZATION>George Washington University</ORGANIZATION> after his second tour in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> in 1971.

In 1962, he married <PERSON>Alma</PERSON>, who is now the co-chair of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Promise. He is the father of <PERSON>Michael Powell</PERSON>, the former chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Communications Commission</ORGANIZATION> (<PERSON>Michael Powell</PERSON> was known mostly for a public battle with radio host <PERSON>Howard Stern</PERSON>).

<PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s first name is fairly common in the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> but rare in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. He pronounces his name "cole-in"; most other men with this name pronounce it "coll-in" in the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION>. In general, public officials and radio and television reporters have used <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s preferred pronunciation.

While at <ORGANIZATION>City College Powell</ORGANIZATION> joined the <ORGANIZATION>Reserve Officers' Training Corps</ORGANIZATION> and later described it as one of the happiest experiences of his life: finding something he loved and could do well, he had "found himself." Cadet <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> joined the <LOCATION>Pershing Rifles</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> fraternal organization and drill team started by GEN <PERSON>John Pershing</PERSON>. Even after <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> became a General, he still kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition. After graduating from <ORGANIZATION>City College</ORGANIZATION> in June 1958, he was granted a commission as an Army Second Lieutenant. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was a professional soldier for 35 years, during which time he held a variety of command and staff positions and rose to the rank of General. 

While serving with the Third Armored Division in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> as a Lieutenant, he met <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON>, then serving in that unit. During the Vietnam War, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was a captain, serving as a <ORGANIZATION>South Vietnamese Army</ORGANIZATION> advisor from 1962 to 1963. While on patrol in a Viet Cong-held area, he was wounded after stepping on a punji stake trap. He returned to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> as a major from 1968 to 1970, where he first served as the executive officer for the Americal Division (23rd Infantry Division), then as the assistant chief of staff of operations for the Americal Division. In that post, he was charged with investigating a detailed letter by <PERSON>Tom Glen</PERSON> (a soldier from the 11th Light Infantry Brigade), which backed up rumored allegations of the My Lai Massacre. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> wrote: "In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between <LOCATION>Americal</LOCATION> soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent." Later, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s assessment would be described as whitewashing the news of the massacre, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public. In May 2004 <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> said to <PERSON>Larry King</PERSON>, "I mean, I was in a unit that was responsible for My <LOCATION>Lai</LOCATION>. I got there after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored."

<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> obtained an MBA from <ORGANIZATION>George Washington University</ORGANIZATION> in 1971 and then served a White House fellowship under President <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>. 

In his autobiography My American Journey, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> mentioned several officers he served under that inspired and mentored him. As a Lieutenant Colonel serving in <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>, for example, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was very close to General <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> "Gunfighter" <PERSON>Emerson</PERSON>. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> said he regarded this man as one of the most caring officers he ever served under. <PERSON>Emerson</PERSON> reputedly had a somewhat eccentric personality. For example, he insisted his troops train only at night and made them repeatedly watch the television film <PERSON>Brian</PERSON>'s Song to promote racial harmony. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> always professed, however, that what set <PERSON>Emerson</PERSON> apart was his great love of his soldiers and concern for their welfare.

 the early 1980s, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> served at <LOCATION>Fort Carson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. It was there that he had a major clash with General <PERSON>John Hudachek</PERSON>, his commander. <PERSON>Hudachek</PERSON> said in an efficiency evaluation that <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was a poor leader who should not be promoted. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s rising military career was unhindered by <PERSON>Hudachek</PERSON>'s evaluation report. After he left <PERSON>Fort Carson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> became senior military assistant to Secretary of Defense <PERSON>Caspar Weinberger</PERSON>, whom he assisted during the 1983 invasion of <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> and the 1986 airstrike on <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION>. 

In 1986, he took over the command of V <ORGANIZATION>Corps</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Frankfurt Germany</LOCATION> from <PERSON>Robert Lewis</PERSON> "Sam" <PERSON>Wetzel</PERSON>. In 1989, prior to being named Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Chiefs of Staff</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> served as the Commander in Chief, Forces Command headquartered at <LOCATION>Fort McPherson</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>.

At the age of 49, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> became <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s National Security Advisor, serving from 1987 to 1989. He retained his Army commission (he was a Lieutenant General at the time of his nomination) while serving as National Security Advisor. After his tenure with the <ORGANIZATION>NSC</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was promoted to 4-star General under President <PERSON>George H.W. Bush</PERSON> and served as Commander-in-Chief (<ORGANIZATION>CINC</ORGANIZATION>) of the <ORGANIZATION>United States Army</ORGANIZATION>'s Forces Command (FORSCOM), overseeing all <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Army Reserve</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> units in the Continental <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION>.



His last military assignment, from October 1, 1989 to September 30, 1993, was as the 12th Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Chiefs of Staff</ORGANIZATION>, the highest military position in the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Defense</ORGANIZATION>. At age 52, he became the youngest officer, and first Afro-Caribbean American, to serve in this position. In 1989, he joined <PERSON>Dwight D. Eisenhower</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander Haig</PERSON> as the third general since World War II to reach four-star rank without ever being a divisional commander. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was also the first JCS Chair who was not a collegiate graduate of a <ORGANIZATION>United States Service</ORGANIZATION> academy, but rather, through ROTC. During this time, he oversaw 28 crises, including the invasion of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> in 1989 to remove General <PERSON>Manuel Noriega</PERSON> from power in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> and Operation Desert Storm in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. During these events, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> earned his nickname, "the reluctant warrior". He rarely advocated military intervention as the first solution to an international dispute, and instead usually prescribed diplomacy and containment.



<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> mentioned in his autobiography that he is haunted by the nightmare of the Vietnam War. He felt the leadership was very ineffective. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> served a tour in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> as a military advisor, and was mildly injured when he stepped on a bamboo "punji stick." The large infection made it difficult for him to walk, and caused his foot to swell for a short time, shortening his first tour. It was also during his <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> service, his second tour, that <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was decorated for bravery. He single-handedly rescued several men from a burning helicopter, one of them being Maj. Gen. <PERSON>Charles Gettys</PERSON>, the commander of the Americal Division.

<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> opposed the majority of <PERSON>George H.W. Bush</PERSON> Administration officials who advocated the deployment of troops to the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> to force <LOCATION>Iraqi</LOCATION> leader <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> to withdraw his armies from neighboring <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>, believing the dictator could instead be contained through sanctions and a buildup of forces around <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION>.

As an officer, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> also valued loyalty very highly. As a military strategist, he has advocated an approach to military conflicts that maximizes the potential for success and minimizes casualties. A component of this approach is the use of overwhelming force, which he applied to Operation Desert Storm in 1991. His approach has been dubbed the "Powell Doctrine".

<PERSON>Colin Powell</PERSON>'s experience in military matters made him a very popular figure with both American political parties. Many Democrats admired his moderate stance on military matters, while many Republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> administrations. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> eventually declared himself a Republican, and began to campaign for Republican candidates. He was touted as a possible opponent of <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> in the 1996 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Presidential Election, but <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> declined.

In 1997 <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> founded <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s Promise with the objective of helping children from all socioeconomic sectors. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> often wears the logo of the organization in the form of a red wagon pin on his lapel.

In the 2000 <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Presidential Election Powell</ORGANIZATION> campaigned for <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Governor <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON>, serving as a key foreign policy advisor to the campaign. At the same time, it was often hinted that <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> might have been appointed to a position within a Democratic administration, should <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> have won. <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> eventually won, and <PERSON>Colin Powell</PERSON> was appointed Secretary of State.



As Secretary of State in the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was perceived as moderate. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s great asset was his tremendous popularity among the American people. Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Secretary of State in 30 years. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was unanimously voted in by the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.

On September 11, 2001, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was in <LOCATION>Lima</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION>, meeting with President <PERSON>Alejandro Toledo</PERSON> and <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> Ambassador to <LOCATION>Peru</LOCATION> <PERSON>John Hamilton</PERSON>, and attending the special session of the <ORGANIZATION>OAS General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> that subsequently adopted the Inter-American Democratic Charter.

After September 11, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s job became of critical importance in managing <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the War on Terrorism.

In April 2002, he visited the site of the alleged <LOCATION>Jenin Massacre</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> and later said while testifying to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, "I've seen no evidence that would suggest a massacre took place." Details of the events were unclear at the time, <PERSON>Shimon Peres</PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION>Ha'aretz</ORGANIZATION> speaking of a  and <ORGANIZATION>IDF</ORGANIZATION> estimates of the dead were in the 100s. Later investigations by human rights organizations and the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> placed the number of deaths amongst Palestinians at 52.

<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> came under fire for his role in building the case for the 2003 Invasion of <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>. In a press statement on February 24, 2001 he had said that sanctions against <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON>. As was the case in the days leading up to the Persian Gulf War, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON>, preferring to continue a policy of containment. However, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> eventually agreed to go along with the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration's determination to remove <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON>. He had often clashed with others in the administration, who were reportedly planning an <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> invasion even before the September 11 attacksan insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar <PERSON>Richard Clarke</PERSON> in front of the 9/11 Commission. The main concession <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> wanted before he would offer his full support for the <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> War was the involvement of the international community in the invasion, as opposed to the unilateral approach some advocated. He was also successful in persuading <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to take the case of <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, and in moderating other initiatives. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign.



<PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s chief role was to garner international support for a multi-national coalition to mount the invasion. To this end, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> addressed a plenary session of the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Security Council</ORGANIZATION> on February 5, 2003 to argue in favor of military action. Citing "numerous" anonymous Iraqi defectors, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> asserted that "there can be no doubt that <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more." <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> also stated that there was "no doubt in my mind" that <PERSON>Saddam</PERSON> was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons.

Most observers praised <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s oratorical skills. However, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s Channel 4 News reported soon afterwards that a <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> intelligence dossier that <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> had referred to as a "fine paper" during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by an American graduate student. A 2004 report by the <ORGANIZATION>Iraq Survey Group</ORGANIZATION> concluded that the evidence that <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> offered to support the allegation that the <LOCATION>Iraqi</LOCATION> government possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) was inaccurate. 

A <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s speech. <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery. The administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence. Reports have indicated that <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> himself was skeptical of the evidence presented to him. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> later recounted how Vice President <PERSON>Cheney</PERSON> had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, "You've got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points." <PERSON>Larry Wilkerson</PERSON> later characterized <PERSON>Cheney</PERSON>'s view of <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s mission as to "go up there and sell it, and we'll have moved forward a peg or two. Fall on your damn sword and kill yourself, and I'll be happy, too."

In September 2005, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was asked about the speech during an interview with <PERSON>Barbara Walters</PERSON> and responded that it was a "blot" on his record. He went on to say, "It will always be a part of my record. It was painful. It's painful now."

Mr. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s longtime aide-de-camp Colonel <PERSON>Lawrence B. Wilkerson</PERSON> said that he participated in a hoax on the American people in preparing Mr. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s erroneous testimony before the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Security Council</ORGANIZATION>.

Because <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration, he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion, such as <PERSON>Donald Rumsfeld</PERSON> and <PERSON>Paul Wolfowitz</PERSON>. At times, infighting between the Powell-led <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION>, the Rumsfeld-led <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION>, and Vice President <PERSON>Dick Cheney</PERSON>'s office had the effect of paralyzing the administration on crucial issues, such as what actions to take regarding <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION>.



After <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> had been deposed, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s new role was to once again establish a working international coalition, this time to assist in the rebuilding of post-war <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>. On September 13, 2004, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> testified before the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Governmental Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION>, acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his February 2003 <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> presentation were "wrong" and that it was "unlikely" that any stockpiles of WMDs would be found. Claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> pushed for reform in the intelligence community, including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that "what one person knew, everyone else knew".

<PERSON>Colin Powell</PERSON> announced his resignation as Secretary of State on Monday, November 15, 2004. According to the <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post</ORGANIZATION>, he had been asked to resign by the president's chief of staff, <PERSON>Andrew Card</PERSON>. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> announced that he would stay on until the end of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s first term or until his replacement's confirmation by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. The following day, <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> nominated National Security Advisor <PERSON>Condoleezza Rice</PERSON> as <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s successor. News of <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s leaving the Administration spurred mixed reactions from politicians around the worldsome upset at the loss of a statesman seen as a moderating factor within the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration, but others hoping for <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s successor to wield more influence within the cabinet, and thus be a more credible negotiator.

In mid-November, <PERSON>Colin Powell</PERSON> stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system. The accusation came at the same time as the settlement of an agreement between the <ORGANIZATION>IAEA</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION>.

On December 31, 2004, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> rang in the New Year by throwing the ball in Times Square with <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Michael Bloomberg</PERSON>, ushering in the year 2005. He appeared on the networks that were broadcasting New Year's Eve specials and talked about this honor, as well as being a native of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>.

After retiring from the role of Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> returned to private life. In April 2005, he was privately telephoned by <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> senators <PERSON>Lincoln Chafee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chuck Hagel</PERSON>, at which time <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of <PERSON>John R. Bolton</PERSON> as ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION>, but refrained from advising the senators to oppose <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> (<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> had clashed with <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> during <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s first term). The decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON>'s chances of confirmation. <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> was put into the position via a recess appointment because of the strong opposition in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.

On 28 April 2005, an opinion piece in the The Guardian by <PERSON>Sidney Blumenthal</PERSON> (a former top aide to President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>) claimed that <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was in fact "conducting a campaign" against <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together, which among other things had resulted in <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> cutting <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> out of talks with <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> after complaints about <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON>'s involvement from the British. <PERSON>Blumenthal</PERSON> added that "The foreign relations committee has discovered that <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> made a highly unusual request and gained access to 10 intercepts by the <ORGANIZATION>National Security Agency</ORGANIZATION>. Staff members on the committee believe that <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> was probably spying on <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>, his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> opposed."

In July 2005, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION>Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers</ORGANIZATION>, a well-known <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION> venture capital firm, with the title of "strategic limited partner".

In September 2005, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> criticized the response to Hurricane Katrina. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> said that thousands of people were not properly protected, but because they were poor rather than because they were black. 

On January 5 2006, he participated in a meeting at the White House of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> foreign policy with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration officials. In September 2006, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> sided with more moderate <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Republicans in supporting more rights for detainees and opposing President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s terrorism bill. He backed Senators <PERSON>John Warner</PERSON>, <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lindsey Graham</PERSON> in their statement that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in the name of fighting terrorism. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> stated that "The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of [<LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s] fight against terrorism."

Also in 2006, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> began appearing as a speaker at a series of motivational events called Get Motivated, along with former <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>Rudy Giuliani</PERSON>. In his speeches for the tour, he openly criticized the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> Administration on a number of issues. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> has been the recipient of mild criticism for his role with Get Motivated which has been called a "get-rich-quick-without-much-effort, feel-good schemology." 

Most recently he joined the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Directors of Steve Case</ORGANIZATION>'s new company <ORGANIZATION>Revolution Health</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> also serves on the Council on Foreign Relations Board of directors.

<PERSON>Powell</PERSON>, in honor of Martin Luther King Day, dropped the ceremonial first puck at a <ORGANIZATION>New York Islanders</ORGANIZATION> game at Nassau Coliseum.

Recently, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> has encouraged young people to continue to use new technologies to their advantage in the future. In a speech at the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Strategic and International Studies</ORGANIZATION> to a room of young professionals, he said, "Thats your generationa generation that is hard-wired digital, a generation that understands the power of the information revolution and how it is transforming the world. A generation that you represent, and youre coming together to share; to debate; to decide; to connect with each other." At this event, he encouraged the next generation to involve themselves politically on the upcoming Next America Project, which uses online debate to provide policy recommendations for the upcoming administration.

In 2008, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> served as a spokesperson for National Mentoring Month, a campaign held each January to recruit volunteer mentors for at-risk youth.

A moderate Republican, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> is well known for his willingness to support liberal or centrist causes. He is pro-choice regarding abortion, and in favor of "reasonable" gun control. He stated in his autobiography that he supports affirmative action that levels the playing field, without giving a leg up to undeserving person because of racial issues. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was also instrumental in the implementation of the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy.

The Vietnam War had a profound effect on <PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s views of the proper use of military force. These views are described in detail in the autobiography My American Journey. The <ORGANIZATION>Powell Doctrine</ORGANIZATION>, as the views became known, was a central component of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> policy in the Gulf War (the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> war in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>) and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> (the overthrow of the <ORGANIZATION>Taliban</ORGANIZATION> regime in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> following the events of "9/11"). The hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation, and the use of overwhelming military force.

<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was the subject of controversy in 2004 when, in a conversation with British Foreign Secretary, <PERSON>Jack Straw</PERSON>, he reportedly referred to neoconservatives within the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration as "fucking crazies". In addition to being reported in the press (though generally, the expletive was censored in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> press), the quote was used by <PERSON>James Naughtie</PERSON> in his book, The Accidental American: <PERSON>Tony Blair</PERSON> and the Presidency, and by <PERSON>Chris Patten</PERSON> in his book, Cousins and Strangers: <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in a New Century.

In a letter to Sen. <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON>, General <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> expressed opposition to President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s push for military tribunals of those formerly and currently classified as enemy combatants. Specifically, he expressed concern of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s plan to "amend the interpretation of Article III of the Geneva Conventions." He also pointed out that perception of the War on Terror may be losing moral support saying, "The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism."In the beginning of 2008, his name was mentioned as a possible running mate of <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> for the 2008 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> presidential election. In the summer of 2007, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> donated the maximum to <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON>'s campaign. However, some have speculated that <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> may ultimately endorse <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON>.

On August 13, 2008, <ORGANIZATION>Fox News</ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON>Bill Kristol</PERSON> stated that <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> will endorse <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> for president and may give a speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> has said in response that "I do not have time to waste on <PERSON>Bill Kristol</PERSON>'s musings." <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>CNN News</ORGANIZATION> in February 2008 that "I will vote for the candidate I think can do the best job in <LOCATION>Americawhether</LOCATION> that candidate is a Republican or Democrat or an independent". But on August 23, <ORGANIZATION>The Politico</ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> was considered by <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> for the vice-presidency.  In the end, <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> did not give a speech at the Democratic National Convention and was not nominated to be the Vice Presidential candidate under <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON>.

In July 2007 <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> revealed that he spent two and a half hours trying to persuade <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> not to invade <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> but that he did not prevail. At the Aspen Ideas Festival in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> stated, "I tried to avoid this war. I took him [<PERSON>Bush</PERSON>] through the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers."

<PERSON>Powell</PERSON> went on to say that he believed <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> was in a state of civil war. "The civil war will ultimately be resolved by a test of arms. It's not going to be pretty to watch, but I don't know any way to avoid it. It is happening now." He further noted, "It is not a civil war that can be put down or solved by the armed forces of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>," and suggested that all the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military could do was put "a heavier lid on this pot of boiling sectarian stew".

<PERSON>Powell</PERSON>'s civilian awards includes two Presidential Medals of Freedom, the President's Citizens Medal, the Congressional Gold Medal, the Secretary of State Distinguished Service Medal, the Secretary of Energy Distinguished Service Medal, and the <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> Freedom Award. Several schools and other institutions have been named in his honor and he holds honorary degrees from universities and colleges across the country.







 







<TITLE><PERSON>Dwight Eisenhower</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>Dwight David</PERSON> "Ike" <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> (October 14, 1890 March 28, 1969) was President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> from 1953 until 1961 and a five-star general in the <ORGANIZATION>United States Army</ORGANIZATION>. During the Second World War, he served as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, with responsibility for planning and supervising the successful invasion of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> in 194445. In 1951, he became the first supreme commander of <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>.

As President, he oversaw the cease-fire of the Korean War, kept up the pressure on the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> during the Cold War, made nuclear weapons a higher defense priority, launched the Space Race, enlarged the Social Security program, and began the Interstate Highway System.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was born <PERSON>David Dwight Eisenhower</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Denison</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, the first president born in that state. He was the third of seven sons born to <PERSON>David Jacob Eisenhower</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ida Elizabeth Stover</PERSON>. The house in which he was born has been preserved as <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> Birthplace State Historic Site and is operated by the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Historical Commission</ORGANIZATION>.

He was named <PERSON>David Dwight</PERSON> and was called <PERSON>Dwight</PERSON>; he reversed the order of his given names when he entered <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION>,, which is also where "Ike" received his nickname.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s paternal ancestors can be traced back to <PERSON>Hans Nicolas Eisenhauer</PERSON>, whose surname was German for "iron worker." <PERSON>Hans Eisenhauer</PERSON> and his family emigrated from <LOCATION>Karlsbrunn</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Saarland</LOCATION>), <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Lancaster</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> in 1741. Descendants made their way west. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s family settled in <LOCATION>Abilene</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> in 1892. His father <PERSON>David Eisenhower</PERSON> was a college-educated engineer. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION>Abilene High School</ORGANIZATION> in 1909.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> married <PERSON>Mamie Geneva Doud</PERSON> (1896 1979) of <LOCATION>Denver</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> on July 1, 1916. The couple had two sons. <PERSON>Doud Dwight Eisenhower</PERSON> was born September 24, 1917, and died of scarlet fever on January 2, 1921, at the age of three. Their second son, <PERSON>John Sheldon David Doud Eisenhower</PERSON>, was born the following year on August 3, 1922; <PERSON>John</PERSON> served in the <ORGANIZATION>United States Army</ORGANIZATION> (retiring as a brigadier general from the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> reserve), became an author, and served as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador to <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> from 1969 to 1971. <PERSON>John</PERSON>, coincidentally, graduated from <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION> on D-Day, June 6, 1944, and was married to <PERSON>Barbara Jean Thompson</PERSON> in a June wedding in 1947. <PERSON>John</PERSON> and <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> had four children: <PERSON>Dwight David II</PERSON>, <PERSON>Barbara Ann</PERSON>, <PERSON>Susan Elaine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Jean</PERSON>. <PERSON>John</PERSON>'s son, <PERSON>David</PERSON>, after whom Camp <PERSON>David</PERSON> is named, married <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON>Julie</PERSON> in 1968.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s paternal ancestor, <PERSON>Hans Nicholas Eisenhauer</PERSON>, was probably of Lutheran or Reformed Protestant practice. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON>Ida E. Eisenhower</PERSON>, previously a member of the <LOCATION>River Brethren</LOCATION> sect of the Mennonites, joined the Watch Tower Bible and <ORGANIZATION>Tract Society</ORGANIZATION> (now more commonly known as <PERSON>Jehovah</PERSON>'s Witnesses) between 1895 and 1900, when <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was a child. The <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915.

When <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Military Academy</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in 1911, his ties to Jehovahs Witnesses were weakened because of the group's anti-militarist stance. By 1915, his parents' home no longer served as the meeting hall. All the men in the household abandoned the Witnesses as adults. Some hid their previous affiliation. At his death in 1942, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s father was given funeral rites as though he remained a <ORGANIZATION>Jehovah</ORGANIZATION>'s Witness. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s mother continued as an active <PERSON>Jehovah</PERSON>'s Witness until her death. Despite their differences in religious beliefs, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> enjoyed a close relationship with his mother. 

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was baptized, confirmed, and became a communicant in the Presbyterian Church in a single ceremony on February 1, 1953, just 12 days after his first inauguration. He is the only president known to have undertaken these rites while in office. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was instrumental in the addition of the words "under God" to the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954, and the 1956 adoption of "In God We Trust" as the motto of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION>, and its 1957 introduction on paper currency. In his retirement years, he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Gettysburg Presbyterian Church</ORGANIZATION>. The chapel at his presidential library is intentionally inter-denominational.

He questioned <PERSON>Billy Graham</PERSON> about how people can be certain they are going to Heaven after death.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was sworn into office with his personal West Point Bible, open to Psalm 33:12, at both his 1953 and 1957 inaugural ceremonies. Additionally for 1953, he included the Bible that <PERSON>George Washington</PERSON> had used in 1789 (belonging to <ORGANIZATION>St. John's Masonic Lodge</ORGANIZATION> No. 1), opened to II Chronicles 7:14.

<PERSON>Dwight D. Eisenhower</PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION>Abilene High School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Abilene</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> and graduated with the class of 1909. He then took a job as a night foreman at the Belle Springs Creamery.

After <PERSON>Dwight</PERSON> worked for two years to support his brother <PERSON>Edgar</PERSON>'s college education, a friend urged him to apply to the <ORGANIZATION>Naval Academy</ORGANIZATION>. Though <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> passed the entrance exam, he was beyond the age of eligibility for admission to the <ORGANIZATION>Naval Academy</ORGANIZATION>.

<LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> Senator <PERSON>Joseph L. Bristow</PERSON> recommended <PERSON>Dwight</PERSON> for an appointment to the <ORGANIZATION>Military Academy</ORGANIZATION> in 1911, which he received. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> graduated in the upper half of the class of 1915.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> long had aspirations of playing professional baseball. He is quoted as saying:

At <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> tried out for the baseball team but did not make it. He would later be quoted as saying that "Not making the baseball team at <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION> was one of the greatest disappointments of my life, maybe my greatest." But <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> did make the football team. He started as a varsity running back and linebacker in 1912. In a bit of a fabled match-up, he even tackled the legendary <PERSON>Jim Thorpe</PERSON> in a 1912 game. The next week however, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> would hurt his knee after being tackled around the ankles, which he would soon worsen and permanently damage on horseback and in the boxing ring. He would later serve as junior varsity football coach and yell leader.

Controversy persists over whether <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> played minor league (semi-professional) baseball for <LOCATION>Junction City</LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Central Kansas League</ORGANIZATION> the year before he attended <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION> and played amateur football there.

In 1916, while stationed at <LOCATION>Fort Sam Houston</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was football coach for <ORGANIZATION>St. Louis College</ORGANIZATION>, now <ORGANIZATION>St. Mary's University</ORGANIZATION>.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> enrolled at the <ORGANIZATION>United States Military Academy</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION> in June 1911. His parents were against militarism, but did not object to his entering West Point because they supported his education. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was a strong athlete and enjoyed notable successes in his competitive endeavors. In 1912, a spectacular <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> touchdown won praise from the sports reporter of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Herald</ORGANIZATION>, and he even managed, with the help of a linebacker teammate, to tackle the legendary <PERSON>Jim Thorpe</PERSON>. In the very next week, however, his promising sports career ended when he incurred a severe knee injury.



<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> graduated in 1915. He served with the infantry until 1918 at various camps in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>. During World War I, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> became the #3 leader of the new tank corps and rose to temporary (Bvt.) Lieutenant Colonel in the <ORGANIZATION>National Army</ORGANIZATION>. He spent the war training tank crews in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and never saw combat. After the war, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> reverted to his regular rank of captain (and was promoted to major a few days later) before assuming duties at <LOCATION>Camp Meade</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>, where he remained until 1922. His interest in tank warfare was strengthened by many conversations with <PERSON>George S. Patton</PERSON> and other senior tank leaders; however their ideas on tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> became executive officer to General <PERSON>Fox Conner</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>Panama Canal Zone</LOCATION>, where he served until 1924. Under <PERSON>Conner</PERSON>'s tutelage, he studied military history and theory (including <PERSON>Karl von Clausewitz</PERSON>'s On War), and later cited <PERSON>Conner</PERSON>'s enormous influence on his military thinking. In 192526, he attended the Command and <ORGANIZATION>General Staff College</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Fort Leavenworth</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, and then served as a battalion commander at <LOCATION>Fort Benning</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> until 1927.



During the late 1920s and early 1930s <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s career in the peacetime Army stagnated; many of his friends resigned for high paying business jobs. He was assigned to the <ORGANIZATION>American Battle Monuments Commission</ORGANIZATION>, directed by General <PERSON>John J. Pershing</PERSON>, then to the <ORGANIZATION>Army War College</ORGANIZATION>, and then served as executive officer to General <PERSON>George V. Mosely</PERSON>, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. He then served as chief military aide to <ORGANIZATION>General Douglas MacArthur</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Army Chief of Staff</ORGANIZATION>, until 1935, when he accompanied <ORGANIZATION>MacArthur</ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION>, where he served as assistant military adviser to the <LOCATION>Philippine</LOCATION> government. It is sometimes said that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of <PERSON>Winston Churchill</PERSON>, <PERSON>George S. Patton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bernard Law Montgomery</PERSON> during World War II. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was promoted to lieutenant colonel (in a non-brevet status) in 1936 after sixteen years as a major. He also learned to fly, although he was never rated as a military pilot. He made a solo flight over the <LOCATION>Philippines</LOCATION> in 1937.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> in 1939 and held a series of staff positions in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. In June 1941, he was appointed Chief of Staff to General <PERSON>Walter Krueger</PERSON>, Commander of the <ORGANIZATION>3rd Army</ORGANIZATION>, at <LOCATION>Fort Sam Houston</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. He was promoted to brigadier general on October 3, 1941. Although his administrative abilities had been noticed, on the eve of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> entry into World War II he had never held an active command and was far from being considered as a potential commander of major operations.



After the Japanese attack on <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was assigned to the General Staff in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of <LOCATION>Pacific</LOCATION> Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division, General <PERSON>Leonard T. Gerow</PERSON>, and then succeeded <PERSON>Gerow</PERSON> as Chief of the War Plans Division. Then he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of Operations Division under Chief of Staff General <PERSON>George C. Marshall</PERSON>. It was his close association with <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> that finally brought <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> to senior command positions. <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> recognized his great organizational and administrative abilities.

In 1942, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was appointed Commanding General, European Theater of Operations (ETOUSA) and was based in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. In November, he was also appointed Supreme Commander Allied (Expeditionary) Force of the North African Theater of Operations (NATOUSA) through the new operational Headquarters A(E)FHQ. The word "expeditionary" was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons. In February 1943, his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the British <ORGANIZATION>8th Army</ORGANIZATION>, commanded by General <PERSON>Bernard Law Montgomery</PERSON>. The 8th Army had advanced across the <LOCATION>Western Desert</LOCATION> from the east and was ready for the start of the <LOCATION>Tunisia</LOCATION> Campaign. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> gained his fourth star and gave up command of <ORGANIZATION>ETOUSA</ORGANIZATION> to be commander of <ORGANIZATION>NATOUSA</ORGANIZATION>. After the capitulation of Axis forces in <LOCATION>North Africa</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> remained in command of the renamed Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO), keeping the operational title and continued in command of <ORGANIZATION>NATOUSA</ORGANIZATION> redesignated MTOUSA. In this position he oversaw the invasion of <LOCATION>Sicily</LOCATION> and the invasion of the Italian mainland.



In December 1943, it was announced that <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> would be Supreme Allied Commander in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. In January 1944, he resumed command of <ORGANIZATION>ETOUSA</ORGANIZATION> and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in May 1945. In these positions he was charged with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION> in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord, the liberation of western <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the invasion of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. A month after the Normandy D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, the invasion of southern <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> took place, and control of the forces which took part in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF. From then until the end of the War in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> on May 8, 1945, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> through SHAEF had supreme command of all operational Allied forces2, and through his command of <LOCATION>ETOUSA</LOCATION>, administrative command of all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces, on the <ORGANIZATION>Western Front</ORGANIZATION> north of the <LOCATION>Alps</LOCATION>.

As recognition of his senior position in the Allied command, on December 20, 1944, he was promoted to General of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies. In this and the previous high commands he held, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy. Although he had never seen action himself, he won the respect of front-line commanders. He dealt skillfully with difficult subordinates such as <PERSON>Omar Bradley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Patton</PERSON>, and allies such as <PERSON>Winston Churchill</PERSON>, Field Marshal <PERSON>Bernard Montgomery</PERSON> and General <PERSON>Charles de Gaulle</PERSON>. He had fundamental disagreements with <PERSON>Churchill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON> over questions of strategy, but these rarely upset his relationships with them. He negotiated with Soviet Marshal <PERSON>Zhukov</PERSON>, and such was the confidence that President <PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON> had in him, he sometimes worked directly with <PERSON>Stalin</PERSON>, much to the chagrin of the British High Command who disliked being bypassed. During the advance towards <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, he was notified by General <PERSON>Bradley</PERSON> that Allied forces would suffer an estimated 100,000 casualties before taking the city. The Soviet Army sustained 80,000 casualties during the fighting in and around <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION>, the last large number of casualties suffered in the war against Nazism.

It was never certain that Operation Overlord would succeed. The seriousness surrounding the entire decision, including the timing and the location of the <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION> invasion, might be summarized by a second shorter speech that <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> wrote in advance, in case he needed it. Long after the successful landings on D-Day and the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> broadcast of <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s brief speech concerning them, the never-used second speech was found in a shirt pocket by an aide. It read:

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> served as Chief of Staff of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> from 194548.  Following the German unconditional surrender on May 8, 1945, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was appointed Military Governor of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Occupation Zone</ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> am Main. <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> was divided into four Occupation Zones, one each for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>. Upon full discovery of the death camps that were part of the Final Solution (Holocaust), he ordered camera crews to comprehensively document evidence of the atrocity for use in the war crimes tribunals. He made the decision to reclassify German prisoners of war (POWs) in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEFs), thus depriving them of the protection of the <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> convention. As DEFs, their food rations could be lowered and they could be compelled to serve as unfree labor (see <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> and German POWs). <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was an early supporter of the Morgenthau Plan to permanently remove <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s industrial capacity to wage future wars. In November 1945 he approved the distribution of 1000 free copies of <PERSON>Morgenthau</PERSON>'s book <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> is Our Problem, which promoted and described the plan in detail, to American military officials in occupied <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. Historian <PERSON>Stephen Ambrose</PERSON> draws the conclusion that, despite <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s later claims the act was not an endorsement of the <PERSON>Morgenthau</PERSON> plan, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> both approved of the plan and had previously given <PERSON>Morgenthau</PERSON> at least some of his ideas about how <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> should be treated. He also incorporated officials from <PERSON>Morgenthau</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> into the army of occupation. These were commonly called "Morgenthau boys" for their zeal in interpreting the occupation directive JCS 1067, which had been heavily influenced by <PERSON>Morgenthau</PERSON> and his plan, as strictly as possible.

In 1948, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> became President of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION>. In December 1950, he took leave from the university when he became the Supreme Commander of the <ORGANIZATION>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>), and given operational command of <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> retired from active service on May 31, 1952, and resumed the university presidency, which he held until January 1953.

1948 also was the year that <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s memoir, Crusade in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, was published. It is widely regarded as one of the finest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military memoirs.

After his many wartime successes, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was a great hero in the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>. He was unusual for a military hero as he never saw the front line in his life. The nearest he came to being under enemy fire was in 1944 when a German fighter strafed the ground while he was inspecting troops in <LOCATION>Normandy</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> dove for cover like everyone else and after the plane flew off, a British brigadier helped him up and seemed very relieved he was not hurt. When <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> thanked him for his solicitude, the brigadier deflated him by explaining "my concern was that you should not be injured in my sector." 

Not long after his return in 1952, a "Draft Eisenhower" movement in the Republican party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-inteventionists Senator <PERSON>Robert Taft</PERSON>. (<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> had been courted by both parties in 1948 and had declined to run then.) <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> defeated <PERSON>Taft</PERSON> for the nomination but came to an agreement that <PERSON>Taft</PERSON> would stay out of foreign affairs while <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> followed a conservative domestic policy. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s campaign was a crusade against the <PERSON>Truman</PERSON> administration's policies regarding "<LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION>, Communism and Corruption" and was also noted for the simple but effective phrase "I Like Ike." <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> promised to go to <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> himself and end the war and maintain both a strong <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> abroad against Communism and a corruption-free frugal administration at home. He and his running mate <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON>, whose daughter later married <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s grandson <PERSON>David</PERSON>, defeated Democrats <PERSON>Adlai Stevenson</PERSON> and <PERSON>John Sparkman</PERSON> in a landslide, marking the first Republican return to the White House in 20 years. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was the only general to serve as President in the 20th century, and the most recent President to have never held elected office prior to the Presidency. (The other Presidents not to have sought prior elected office were <PERSON>Zachary Taylor</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>, <PERSON>William Taft</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Herbert Hoover</PERSON>.)



Throughout his presidency, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> preached a doctrine of dynamic conservatism. He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation, especially Social Security. He expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency, the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Health, Education and Welfare</ORGANIZATION>, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. His cabinet, consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader, was dubbed by one journalist, "Eight millionaires and a plumber."

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> won his second term in 1956 with 457 of 531 votes in the <ORGANIZATION>Electoral College</ORGANIZATION>, and 57.6% of the popular vote.



One of <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s enduring achievements was championing and signing the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in 1956. He justified the project through the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 as essential to American security during the Cold War. It was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible future war, and the highways were designed to evacuate them and allow the military to move in.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s goal to create improved highways was influenced by his involvement in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION>'s 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy. He was assigned as an observer for the mission, which involved sending a convoy of <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> vehicles coast to coast. His subsequent experience with German autobahns during World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System. Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country, he thought an Interstate Highway System in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would not only be beneficial for military operations, but be the building block for continued economic growth.

After the Suez Crisis, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> became the protector of most Western interests in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>. As a result, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> proclaimed the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in January 1957. In relation to the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> would be "prepared to use armed force...[to counter] aggression from any country controlled by international communism." On July 15, 1958, he sent just under 15,000 soldiers to <LOCATION>Lebanon</LOCATION> (a combined force of <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION>) as part of Operation Blue Bat, a non-combat peace keeping mission to stabilize the pro-Western government. They left the following October.

In addition, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> explored the option of supporting the French colonial forces in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> who were fighting an independence insurrection there. However, Chief of Staff <PERSON>Matthew Ridgway</PERSON> dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> supported the 1954 <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> v. <ORGANIZATION>Board of Education of Topeka U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision, in which segregated ("separate but equal") schools were ruled to be unconstitutional. The very next day he told <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> officials to make <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children. He proposed to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 and signed those acts into law. Although both Acts were weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation, they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since the 1870s.The "Little Rock Nine" incident of 1957 involved the refusal by <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> to honor a Federal court order to integrate the schools. Under , <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> placed the <ORGANIZATION>Arkansas National Guard</ORGANIZATION> under Federal control and sent <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> troops to escort nine black students into an all-white public school. The integration did not occur without violence. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> governor <PERSON>Orval Faubus</PERSON> engaged in tense arguments.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> appointed the following Justices to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>:



In 1961, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> became the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president to be "constitutionally forced" from office, having served the maximum two terms allowed by the 22nd Amendment to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Constitution. The amendment was ratified in 1951, during <PERSON>Harry S. Truman</PERSON>'s term, but it stipulated that <PERSON>Truman</PERSON> would not be affected by the amendment.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was also the first outgoing President to come under the protection of the Former Presidents Act (two then living former Presidents, <PERSON>Herbert Hoover</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harry S. Truman</PERSON>, left office before Act was passed). Under the act, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> was entitled to receive a lifetime pension, state-provided staff and a Secret Service detail. 

In the 1960 election to choose his successor, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> endorsed his own Vice President, Republican <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> against Democrat <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>. However, he only campaigned for <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> in the campaign's final days and even did <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> some harm. When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON>'s policy ideas he had adopted, he replied, "If you give me a week, I might think of one." <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>'s campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials. <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> lost narrowly to <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON>.

On January 17, 1961, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the Oval Office. In his farewell speech to the nation, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> armed forces. He described the Cold War saying: "We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose and insidious in method..." and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that "we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex... Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together."

Because of legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> resigned his permanent commission as General of the Army before entering the office of President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Upon completion of his Presidential term, his commission on the retired list was reactivated and <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> again was commissioned a five-star general in the <ORGANIZATION>United States Army</ORGANIZATION>.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> retired to the place where he and <PERSON>Mamie</PERSON> had spent much of their post-war time, a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>. In 1967, the <ORGANIZATION>Eisenhowers</ORGANIZATION> donated the farm to the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> and since 1980 it has been open to the public as the Eisenhower National Historic Site. In retirement, he did not completely retreat from political life; he spoke at the 1964 Republican National Convention and appeared with <PERSON>Barry Goldwater</PERSON> in a <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> campaign commercial from <LOCATION>Gettysburg</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> died of congestive heart failure on March 28, 1969 at <ORGANIZATION>Walter Reed Army Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington D.C</LOCATION>. The following day his body was moved to the <ORGANIZATION>Washington National Cathedral</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Bethlehem Chapel</LOCATION> where he lay in repose for twenty-eight hours. On March 30, his body was brought by caisson to the <LOCATION>United States Capitol</LOCATION> where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. On March 31, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s body was returned to the <ORGANIZATION>National Cathedral</ORGANIZATION> where he was given an <ORGANIZATION>Episcopal Church</ORGANIZATION> funeral service. That evening, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s body was placed onto a train en route to <LOCATION>Abilene</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>. His body arrived on April 2, and was interred later that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Library. <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> is buried alongside his son <PERSON>Doud</PERSON> who died at age 3 in 1921, and his wife, <PERSON>Mamie</PERSON>, who died in 1979.

After <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> left office, his reputation declined and he was seen as having been a "do-nothing" President. This was partly because of the contrast between <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> and his young activist successor, <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>, but also because of his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree that activists would have preferred, his handling of the 1960 U-2 incident, the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s perceived leadership in the Arms race and the Space race, and his failure publicly to oppose McCarthyism, in particular his failure to defend <PERSON>George Marshall</PERSON> from attacks by <PERSON>Joseph McCarthy</PERSON>, though he privately deplored <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON>'s tactics and claims. Such omissions were held against him during the liberal climate of the 1960s and 1970s. Since that time, however, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s reputation has risen. In recent surveys of historians, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> often is ranked in the top 10 among all <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> Presidents.

<PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON>'s picture was on the dollar coin from 1971 to 1978. Nearly 700 million of the copper-nickel clad coins were minted for general circulation, and far smaller numbers of uncirculated and proof issues (in both copper-nickel and 40% silver varieties) were produced for collectors. He reappeared on a commemorative silver dollar issued in 1990, celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth, which with a double image of him showed his two roles, as both a soldier and a statesman. As part of the Presidential $1 Coin Program, <PERSON>Eisenhower</PERSON> will be featured on a gold-colored dollar coin in 2015.

He is remembered for ending the Korean War. USS ''<PERSON>Dwight D. Eisenhower</PERSON>'', the second ''Nimitz''-class supercarrier, was named in his honor.

<ORGANIZATION>Eisenhower College</ORGANIZATION> was a small, liberal arts college chartered in <LOCATION>Seneca Falls</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in 1965, with classes beginning in 1968. Financial problems forced the school to fall under the management of the <ORGANIZATION>Rochester Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> in 1979. Its last class graduated in 1982.

The <ORGANIZATION>Eisenhower Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> in Rancho Mirage, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> was named after the President in 1971.

<TITLE><PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>His</PERSON> initial 1492 voyage came at a critical time of growing national imperialism and economic competition between developing nation states seeking wealth from the establishment of trade routes and colonies. In this sociopolitical climate, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s far-fetched scheme won the attention of Queen <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. Severely underestimating the circumference of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, he hypothesized that a westward route from <ORGANIZATION>Iberia</ORGANIZATION> to the Indies would be shorter and more direct than the overland trade route through Arabia. If true, this would allow <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> entry into the lucrative spice tradeheretofore commanded by the Arabs and Italians. Following his plotted course, he instead landed within the <LOCATION>Bahamas Archipelago</LOCATION> at a locale he named <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION>. Mistaking the North-American island for the East-Asian mainland, he referred to its inhabitants as "Indians".

Academic consensus is that <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION>, though there are other theories. The name <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> is the Anglicisation of the Latin Christophorus Columbus. The name is rendered in modern Italian as <PERSON>Cristoforo Colombo</PERSON>, in <LOCATION>Portuguese</LOCATION> as Cristvo <LOCATION>Colombo</LOCATION> (formerly Christovam Colom), and in Spanish as <PERSON>Cristbal Coln</PERSON>.

The anniversary of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' 1492 landing in the Americas (Columbus Day) is observed throughout the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> on October 12.

At age 14, he attended Prince <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>'s school of navigation in <LOCATION>Sagres</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>. He spoke a Genoese dialect. In one of his writings, <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> claims to have gone to the sea at the age of 10. In 1470 the <ORGANIZATION>Columbus Family</ORGANIZATION> moved to <LOCATION>Savona</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Domenico</PERSON> took over a tavern. In the same year, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was on a Genoese ship hired in the service of Ren I of <LOCATION>Anjou</LOCATION> to support his attempt to conquer the Kingdom of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>. 

In 1473 <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> began his apprenticeship as business agent for the important Centurione, <PERSON>Di Negro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spinola</PERSON> families of <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION>. Later he allegedly made a trip to Chios, a Genoese colony in the <LOCATION>Aegean Sea</LOCATION>. In May 1476, he took part in an armed convoy sent by <ORGANIZATION>Genoa</ORGANIZATION> to carry a valuable cargo to northern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. He docked in <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Galway</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> and was possibly in <LOCATION>Iceland</LOCATION> in 1477. In 1479 Columbus reached his brother <PERSON>Bartolomeo</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>, keeping on trading for the Centurione family. He married <PERSON>Filipa Moniz Perestrello</PERSON>, daughter of the <ORGANIZATION>Porto Santo</ORGANIZATION> governor, the <LOCATION>Portuguese</LOCATION> nobleman of Genoese origin <PERSON>Bartolomeu Perestrello</PERSON>. In 1479 or 1480, his son, <PERSON>Diego</PERSON>, was born.



<LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> had long enjoyed a safe land passage to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> sources of valued goods such as silk, spices, and opiates under the hegemony of the Mongol Empire (the <LOCATION>Pax Mongolica</LOCATION>, or Mongol peace). With the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, the land route to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> became more difficult. The Columbus brothers had a different idea. By the 1480s, they had developed a plan to travel to the Indies, then construed roughly as all of south and east <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>, by sailing directly west across the "<LOCATION>Ocean Sea</LOCATION>," i.e., the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Washington Irving</PERSON>'s 1828 biography of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> popularized the idea that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because Europeans thought the Earth was flat. In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the spherical Earth. The knowledge that the Earth was spherical was widespread and the means of calculating its diameter using an astrolabe was known to both scholars and navigators. The spherical view of the earth had been the general opinion of Ancient Greek science, and continued as the standard view in the Middle Ages (for example of Bede in The Reckoning of Time). In fact the Earth had generally been believed to be spherical since the 4th century BCE by most scholars and almost all navigators, and <PERSON>Eratosthenes</PERSON> had measured the diameter of the Earth with good precision in the second century BC. Columbus put forth (incorrect) arguments based on a significantly smaller diameter for the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION>, claiming that <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> could be easily reached by sailing west across the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>. Most scholars accepted <PERSON>Ptolemy</PERSON>'s correct assessment that the terrestrial landmass (for Europeans of the time, comprising <ORGANIZATION>Eurasia</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>) occupied 180 degrees of the terrestrial sphere, and correctly dismissed <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION>'s claim that the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> was much smaller, and that <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> was only a few thousand nautical miles to the west of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. Columbus' error was put down to his lack of experience in navigation at sea.

Columbus believed the (incorrect) calculations of <ORGANIZATION>Marinus of Tyre</ORGANIZATION>, putting the landmass at 225 degrees, leaving only 135 degrees of water. Moreover, <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> believed that one degree represented a shorter distance on the earth's surface than was actually the case. Finally, he read maps as if the distances were calculated in Italian miles (1,238 meters). Accepting the length of a degree to be 56 miles, from the writings of <LOCATION>Alfraganus</LOCATION>, he therefore calculated the circumference of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> as 25,255 kilometers at most, and the distance from the <LOCATION>Canary Islands</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> as 3,000 Italian miles (3,700 km, or 2,300 statute miles) <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> did not realize <PERSON>Al-Farghani</PERSON> used the much longer Arabic mile (about 1,830 m).

The main problem was that experts did not accept his estimate. The true circumference of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> is about 40,000 km (25,000 sm), a figure established by Eratosthenes in the second century BC, and the distance from the <LOCATION>Canary Islands</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 19,600 km (12,200 sm). No ship that was readily available in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a journey. Most European sailors and navigators concluded, likely correctly, that sailors undertaking a westward voyage from <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> non-stop would die of thirst or starvation long before reaching their destination. <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, however, having completed an expensive war, was desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in trade with the <LOCATION>East Indies</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> promised such an advantage.

While Columbus' calculations underestimated the circumference of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> and the distance from the <LOCATION>Canary Islands</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> by the standards of his peers as well as in fact, almost all Europeans held the mistaken opinion that the aquatic expanse between <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> was uninterrupted. As the 16th century developed it was the route to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, rather than to <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>, that gave <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> a competitive edge in developing an overseas empire.

There was a further element of key importance in the plans of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, a closely-held fact discovered by or otherwise learned by Columbus: the trade winds. A brisk wind from the east, commonly called an "easterly", propelled <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>La Nina, & La Pinta</ORGANIZATION> for 5 weeks from the Canaries. To return to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> eastward against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique, called beating, during which food & drinkable water would have been utterly exhausted. Columbus returned home by following prevailing winds northeastward from the southern zone of the <LOCATION>North Atlantic</LOCATION> to the middle latitudes of the <LOCATION>North Atlantic</LOCATION>, where prevailing winds are eastward (westerly) to the coastlines of <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION>, where the winds curve southward towards the <LOCATION>Iberian Peninsula</LOCATION>. In fact, <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> was wrong about degrees of longitude to be traversed and wrong about distance per degree, but he was right about a more vital fact: how to use the <LOCATION>North Atlantic</LOCATION>'s great circular wind pattern, clockwise in direction, to get home. 

Some mean that his confidence in that land was within reach, was based on his travel in 1477 (1476-1477), which may have taken him to <LOCATION>Baffin Island</LOCATION> at 73 degrees north (in German). On this tour he could also get information from norse sailors and inuit kayakers trading on the long coast extending from north to south at about this longitude, almost to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. A History of <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION>..., 12th century p. 3, lines 2-5: This country, which was discovered, settled and confirmed in the universal faith by Icelanders, is the western boundary of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, almost touching the African islands where the waters of ocean flood in.

In 1485, <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> presented his plans to <PERSON>John II</PERSON>, King of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>. He proposed the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out into the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION>, search for a western route to Orient, and then return home. Columbus also requested he be made "Great Admiral of the Ocean", created governor of any and all lands he discovered, and given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands discovered. The king submitted the proposal to his experts, who rejected it. It was their considered opinion that <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON>' proposed route of  was, in fact, far too short.



In 1488 <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> appealed to the court of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> once again, and once again <PERSON>John</PERSON> invited him to an audience. It too was to come to nothing, for not long afterwards came the arrival of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>'s native son <PERSON>Bartholomeu Dias</PERSON> from a successful rounding of the southern tip of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION>. <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> was no longer interested in trailblazing a western route to the East. 

Columbus travelled from <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION> once more to both <ORGANIZATION>Genoa</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Venice</LOCATION>, but he received encouragement from neither. Previously he had his brother sound out <PERSON>Henry VII</PERSON> of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, to see if the English monarch might not be more amenable to Columbus' proposal. After much carefully considered hesitation <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>'s invitation came, too late. <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> had already committed himself to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.



He had sought an audience from the monarchs <PERSON>Ferdinand II</PERSON> of <PERSON>Aragon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Isabella I</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Castile</LOCATION>, who had united the largest kingdoms of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> by marrying, and were ruling together. On May 1, 1486, permission having been granted, <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> laid his plans before <PERSON>Queen Isabella</PERSON>, who, in turn, referred it to a committee. After the passing of much time, these savants of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, like their counterparts in <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, reported back that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had judged the distance to <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> much too short. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised their Royal Highnesses to pass on the proposed venture.

However, to keep <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> from taking his ideas elsewhere, and perhaps to keep their options open, the King and Queen of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> gave him an annual annuity of 12,000 maravedis ($840) and in 1489 furnished him with a letter ordering all Spanish cities and towns to provide him food and lodging at no cost.

After continually lobbying at the Spanish court and two years of negotiations, he finally had success in 1492. <PERSON>Ferdinand</PERSON> and <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> had just conquered <PERSON>Granada</PERSON>, the last Muslim stronghold on the <LOCATION>Iberian</LOCATION> peninsula, and they received <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Crdoba</LOCATION>, in the Alczar castle. <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> turned <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> down on the advice of her confessor, and he was leaving town in despair, when <PERSON>Ferdinand</PERSON> intervened. <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> then sent a royal guard to fetch him and <PERSON>Ferdinand</PERSON> later rightfully claimed credit for being "the principal cause why those islands were discovered". King <PERSON>Ferdinand</PERSON> is referred to as "losing his patience" in this issue, but this cannot be proven.

About half of the financing was to come from private Italian investors, whom <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> had already lined up. Financially broke after the <PERSON>Granada</PERSON> campaign, the monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made "Admiral of the Seas" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous, but as his own son later wrote, the monarchs did not really expect him to return.

According to the contract that <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> made with King <PERSON>Ferdinand</PERSON> and <PERSON>Queen Isabella</PERSON>, if <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> discovered any new islands or mainland, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the <LOCATION>Ocean Sea</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION>) and appointed <PERSON>Viceroy</PERSON> and Governor of all the new lands. He had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to 10 percent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity; this part was denied to him in the contract, although it was one of his demands.Finally, he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits.

<PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> was later arrested in 1500 and supplanted from these posts. After his death, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s sons, <PERSON>Diego</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fernando</PERSON>, took legal action to enforce their father's contract. Many of the smears against <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> were initiated by the Spanish crown during these lengthy court cases, known as the pleitos colombinos. The family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed <PERSON>Diego</PERSON>'s position as <PERSON>Viceroy</PERSON>, but reduced his powers. <PERSON>Diego</PERSON> resumed litigation in 1512, which lasted until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.

On the evening of August 3, 1492, <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> departed from <LOCATION>Palos de la Frontera</LOCATION> with three ships; one larger carrack, <LOCATION>Santa Mara</LOCATION>, nicknamed Gallega (the Galician), and two smaller caravels, Pinta (the Painted) and <LOCATION>Santa Clara</LOCATION>, nicknamed <PERSON>Nia</PERSON> after her owner <PERSON>Juan Nio</PERSON> of <PERSON>Moguer</PERSON>. They were property of <PERSON>Juan de la Cosa</PERSON> and the <LOCATION>Pinzn</LOCATION> brothers (<ORGANIZATION>Martin Alonzo</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Vicente Yez</PERSON>), but the monarchs forced the Palos inhabitants to contribute to the expedition. Columbus first sailed to the <LOCATION>Canary Islands</LOCATION>, which were owned by <LOCATION>Castile</LOCATION>, where he restocked the provisions and made repairs, and on September 6, he started what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean. 

Land was sighted at 2 a.m. on October 12, 1492, by a sailor named <PERSON>Rodrigo de Triana</PERSON> (also known as <PERSON>Juan Rodrguez Bermejo</PERSON>) aboard <LOCATION>Pinta</LOCATION>. Columbus called the island (in what is now The <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION>) <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION>; the natives called it Guanahani. Exactly which island in the <LOCATION>Bahamas</LOCATION> this corresponds to is an unresolved topic; prime candidates are <PERSON>Samana Cay</PERSON>, Plana Cays, or <LOCATION>San Salvador Island</LOCATION> (named <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION> in 1925 in the belief that it was Columbus's <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION>). The indigenous people he encountered, the <LOCATION>Lucayan</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Tano</PERSON> or Arawak, were peaceful and friendly. From the October 12, 1492 entry in his journal he wrote of them, "Many of the men I have seen have scars on their bodies, and when I made signs to them to find out how this happened, they indicated that people from other nearby islands come to <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION> to capture them; they defend themselves the best they can. I believe that people from the mainland come here to take them as slaves. They ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them. I think they can very easily be made Christians, for they seem to have no religion. If it pleases our Lord, I will take six of them to Your Highnesses when I depart, in order that they may learn our language." Lacking modern weaponry and even metal-forged swords or pikes, he remarked upon their tactical vulnerability, writing, "I could conquer the whole of them with 50 men, and govern them as I pleased." 

Columbus also explored the northeast coast of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> (landed on October 28) and the northern coast of <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION>, by December 5. Here, the <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION> ran aground on Christmas morning 1492 and had to be abandoned. He was received by the native cacique <PERSON>Guacanagari</PERSON>, who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> left 39 men and founded the settlement of <LOCATION>La Navidad</LOCATION> in what is now present-day <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>. Before returning to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> also kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the native Indians arrived in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> alive, but they made quite an impression on <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>.

<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> headed for <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, but another storm forced him into <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION>. He anchored next to the King's harbor patrol ship on March 4, 1493 in <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>. After spending more than one week in <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>, he set sail for <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. He reached <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> on March 15, 1493. Word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.

There is increasing modern scientific evidence that this voyage also brought syphilis back from the <LOCATION>New World</LOCATION>. Many of the crew members who served on this voyage later joined the army of King <PERSON>Charles VIII</PERSON> in his invasion of <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> in 1495 resulting in the spreading of the disease across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and as many as 5 million deaths.



<PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> left <PERSON>Cdiz</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, on September 24, 1493 to find new territories, with 17 ships carrying supplies, and about 1,200 men to colonize the region. On October 13, the ships left the <LOCATION>Canary Islands</LOCATION> as they had on the first voyage, following a more southerly course.

On November 3, 1493, <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> sighted a rugged island that he named <LOCATION>Dominica</LOCATION> (Latin for Sunday); later that day, he landed at Marie-Galante, which he named <PERSON>Santa Maria la Galante</PERSON>. After sailing past <PERSON>Les Saintes</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>Los Santos</ORGANIZATION>, The Saints), he arrived at <LOCATION>Guadeloupe</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Santa Mara de Guadalupe de Extremadura</LOCATION>, after the image of the <PERSON>Virgin Mary</PERSON> venerated at the Spanish monastery of <LOCATION>Villuercas</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Guadalupe</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>), which he explored between November 4 and November 10, 1493.

The exact course of his voyage through the Lesser Antilles is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming several islands, including <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION> (for <LOCATION>Santa Maria de Montserrate</LOCATION>, after the Blessed Virgin of the Monastery of <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>, which is located on the Mountain of <LOCATION>Montserrat</LOCATION>, in <LOCATION>Catalonia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>), <LOCATION>Antigua</LOCATION> (after a church in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, called <LOCATION>Santa Maria la Antigua</LOCATION>, meaning "Old St. <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>'s"), Redonda (for <LOCATION>Santa Maria la Redonda</LOCATION>, Spanish for "round", owing to the island's shape), <LOCATION>Nevis</LOCATION> (derived from the Spanish, <PERSON>Nuestra Seora de las Nieves</PERSON>, meaning "Our Lady of the Snows", because <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> thought the clouds over <LOCATION>Nevis Peak</LOCATION> made the island resemble a snow-capped mountain), Saint <PERSON>Kitts</PERSON> (for <PERSON>St. Christopher</PERSON>, patron of sailors and travelers), <LOCATION>Sint Eustatius</LOCATION> (for the early Roman martyr, St. Eustachius), <LOCATION>Saba</LOCATION> (also for St. <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON>?), Saint <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> (<ORGANIZATION>San Martin</ORGANIZATION>), and Saint <PERSON>Croix</PERSON> (from the <LOCATION>Spanish Santa Cruz</LOCATION>, meaning "Holy Cross"). He also sighted the island chain of the <LOCATION>Virgin Islands</LOCATION> (and named them <ORGANIZATION>Islas de Santa Ursula y las Once Mil Virgenes</ORGANIZATION>, Saint <PERSON>Ursula</PERSON> and the 11,000 Virgins, a cumbersome name that was usually shortened, both on maps of the time and in common parlance, to <PERSON>Islas Virgenes</PERSON>), and he also named the islands of <PERSON>Virgin Gorda</PERSON> (the fat virgin), <LOCATION>Tortola</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Peter Island</PERSON> (<LOCATION>San Pedro</LOCATION>).

He continued to the Greater Antilles, and landed at <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> (originally <LOCATION>San Juan Bautista</LOCATION>, in honor of Saint <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Baptist, a name that was later supplanted by <LOCATION>Puerto Rico</LOCATION> (English: <LOCATION>Rich Port</LOCATION>) while the capital retained the name, <LOCATION>San Juan</LOCATION>) on November 19, 1493. One of the first skirmishes between native Americans and Europeans since the time of the <ORGANIZATION>Vikings</ORGANIZATION> took place when <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION>'s men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.

On November 22, <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION>, where he intended to visit Fuerte de la Navidad (Christmas Fort), built during his first voyage, and located on the northern coast of <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION>Fuerte de la Navidad</ORGANIZATION> was found in ruins, destroyed by the native Taino people, whereupon, <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> moved more than 100 kilometers eastwards, establishing a new settlement, which he called <LOCATION>La Isabela</LOCATION>, likewise on the northern coast of <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION>, in the present-day <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>. However, <PERSON>La Isabela</PERSON> proved to be a poorly-chosen location, and the settlement was short-lived.

He left <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION> on April 24, 1494, arrived at <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> (naming it Juana) on April 30. He explored the southern coast of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>, which he believed to be a peninsula rather than an island, and several nearby islands, including the Isle of <LOCATION>Pines</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Isla de las Pinas</ORGANIZATION>, later known as <ORGANIZATION>La Evangelista</ORGANIZATION>, The Evangelist). He reached <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION> on May 5. He retraced his route to <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION>, arriving on August 20, before he finally returned to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>.

During his second voyage, <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> and his men instituted a policy in Hispaniola which has been referred to by numerous historians as genocide. The native Taino people of the island were systematically enslaved and murdered. Hundreds were rounded up and shipped to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to be sold; many died en route. For the rest of the population, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> demanded that all Taino under his control should bring the Spaniards gold. Those that didn't were to have their hands cut off. Since there was, in fact, little gold to be had, the Taino fled, and the Spaniards hunted them down and killed them. The Taino tried to mount a resistance, but the <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> weaponry was superior, and European diseases ravaged their population. In despair, the Taino engaged in mass suicide, even killing their own children to save them from the Spaniards. Within two years, half of what may have been 250,000 Taino were dead. The remainder were taken as slaves and set to work on plantations, where the mortality rate was very high. By 1550, 60 years after <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> landed, only a few hundred Taino were left on their island. In another hundred years, perhaps only a handful remained.



On May 30, 1498, <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> left with six ships from <LOCATION>Sanlcar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, for his third trip to the New World. He was accompanied by the young <PERSON>Bartolom de Las Casas</PERSON>, who would later provide partial transcripts of Columbus' logs. 

Columbus led the fleet to the <LOCATION>Portuguese</LOCATION> island of <LOCATION>Porto Santo</LOCATION>, his wife's native land. He then sailed to <LOCATION>Madeira</LOCATION> and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain <PERSON>Joo Gonalves</PERSON> da Camara before sailing to the <LOCATION>Canary Islands</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cape Verde</LOCATION>. Columbus landed on the south coast of the island of <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> on July 31. From August 4 through August 12, he explored the Gulf of <LOCATION>Paria</LOCATION> which separates <LOCATION>Trinidad</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>. He explored the mainland of <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION>, including the <LOCATION>Orinoco River</LOCATION>. He also sailed to the islands of Chacachacare and <LOCATION>Margarita Island</LOCATION> and sighted and named <LOCATION>Tobago</LOCATION> (<LOCATION>Bella Forma</LOCATION>) and <LOCATION>Grenada</LOCATION> (Concepcion). 

Columbus returned to <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION> on August 19 to find that many of the Spanish settlers of the new colony were discontented, having been misled by <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> about the supposedly bountiful riches of the new world. An entry in his journal from September 1498 reads, "From here one might send, in the name of the Holy Trinity, as many slaves as could be sold..." Indeed, as a fierce supporter of slavery, <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> ultimately refused to baptize the native people of <LOCATION>Hispanolia</LOCATION>, since <ORGANIZATION>Catholic</ORGANIZATION> law forbade the enslavement of Christians. 

Columbus repeatedly had to deal with rebellious settlers and natives.  He had some of his crew hanged for disobeying him. A number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> court, accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement. On his return he was arrested for a period (see Governorship and arrest section below).

<PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> made a fourth voyage nominally in search of the Strait of <LOCATION>Malacca</LOCATION> to the <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION>. Accompanied by his brother <PERSON>Bartolomeo</PERSON> and his 13-year-old son <PERSON>Fernando</PERSON>, he left <PERSON>Cdiz</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, on May 11, 1502, with the ships Capitana, Gallega, <PERSON>Vizcana</PERSON> and <PERSON>Santiago de Palos</PERSON>. He sailed to Arzila on the Moroccan coast to rescue <LOCATION>Portuguese</LOCATION> soldiers whom he had heard were under siege by the Moors. On June 15, they landed at <LOCATION>Carbet</LOCATION> on the island of <LOCATION>Martinique</LOCATION> (<PERSON>Martinica</PERSON>). A hurricane was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION> on June 29, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION>' ships sheltered at the mouth of the <LOCATION>Rio Jaina</LOCATION>, the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. Columbus' ships survived with only minor damage, while twenty-nine of the thirty ships in the governor's fleet were lost to the July 1 storm. In addition to the ships, 500 lives (including that of the governor, <PERSON>Francisco de Bobadilla</PERSON>) and an immense cargo of gold were surrendered to the sea. 

After a brief stop at <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> sailed to <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION>, arriving at <LOCATION>Guanaja</LOCATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Isla de Pinos</ORGANIZATION>) in the <LOCATION>Bay Islands</LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> on July 30. Here <PERSON>Bartolomeo</PERSON> found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as "long as a galley" and was filled with cargo. On August 14, he landed on the American mainland at <LOCATION>Puerto Castilla</LOCATION>, near <LOCATION>Trujillo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>. He spent two months exploring the coasts of <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION>, before arriving in <LOCATION>Almirante Bay</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> on October 16.

On December 5, 1502, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and his crew found themselves in a storm unlike any they had ever experienced. In his journal <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> writes,For nine days I was as one lost, without hope of life. Eyes never beheld the sea so angry, so high, so covered with foam. The wind not only prevented our progress, but offered no opportunity to run behind

any headland for shelter; hence we were forced to keep out in this bloodyocean, seething like a pot on a hot fire. Never did the sky look more terrible; for one whole day and night it blazed like a furnace, and the lightning broke with such violence that each time I wondered if it had carried off my spars and sails; the flashes came with such fury and frightfulness that we all thought that the ship would be blasted. Allthis time the water never ceased to fall from the sky; I do not say it rained, for it was like another deluge. The men were so worn out that they longed for death to end their dreadful suffering.

In <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> learned from the natives of gold and a strait to another ocean. After much exploration, in January 1503 he established a garrison at the mouth of the <LOCATION>Rio Belen</LOCATION>. On April 6 one of the ships became stranded in the river. At the same time, the garrison was attacked, and the other ships were damaged. Columbus left for <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION> on April 16, heading north. On May 10 he sighted the <LOCATION>Cayman Islands</LOCATION>, naming them "Las Tortugas" after the numerous sea turtles there. His ships next sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>. Unable to travel farther, on June 25, 1503, they were beached in <LOCATION>St. Ann's Bay</LOCATION>, Jamaica.For a year <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> and his men remained stranded on <LOCATION>Jamaica</LOCATION>. A Spaniard, <PERSON>Diego Mendez</PERSON>, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION>. That island's governor, <PERSON>Nicols de Ovando</PERSON> y Cceres, detested <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men, successfully intimidated the natives by correctly predicting a lunar eclipse for February 29, 1504, using the Ephemeris of the German astronomer Regiomontanus. Help finally arrived, no thanks to the governor, on June 29, 1504, and <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> and his men arrived in <LOCATION>Sanlcar</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, on November 7.

During Columbus' stint as governor and viceroy, he had been accused of governing tyrannically. . <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> was physically and mentally exhausted; his body was wracked by arthritis and his eyes by ophthalmia. In October 1499, he sent two ships to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, asking the Court of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.

The Court appointed <PERSON>Francisco de Bobadilla</PERSON>, a member of the Order of Calatrava; however, his authority stretched far beyond what <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had requested. <PERSON>Bobadilla</PERSON> was given total control as governor from 1500 until his death in 1502. Arriving in <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION> while <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was away, <PERSON>Bobadilla</PERSON> was immediately peppered with complaints about all three <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> brothers: <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bartolom</PERSON>, and Diego. <PERSON>Consuelo Varela</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Spanish</LOCATION> historian, states: "Even those who loved him [<ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION>] had to admit the atrocities that had taken place." 

As a result of these testimonies and without being allowed a word in his own defense, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> upon his return, had manacles placed on his arms and chains on his feet and was cast into prison to await return to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. He was 53 years old. 

On October 1, 1500, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. Once in <LOCATION>Cdiz</LOCATION>, a grieving <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> wrote to a friend at court:

It is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land....

I beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.

According to testimony of 23 witnesses during his trial, <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> regularly used barbaric acts of torture to govern Hispaniola.

<PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> and his brothers lingered in jail for six weeks before the busy King <PERSON>Ferdinand</PERSON> ordered their release. Not long thereafter, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the <LOCATION>Alhambra</LOCATION> palace in <LOCATION>Granada</LOCATION>. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus' fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>'s role as governor. From that point forward, <PERSON>Nicols de Ovando</PERSON> y Cceres was to be the new governor of the <LOCATION>West Indies</LOCATION>.



While <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> had always given the conversion of non-believers as one reason for his explorations, he grew increasingly religious in his later years. He claimed to hear divine voices, lobbied for a new crusade to capture <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION>, often wore Franciscan habit, and described his explorations to the "paradise" as part of God's plan which would soon result in the Last Judgment and the end of the world.

In his later years, <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> demanded that the Spanish Crown give him 10 per cent of all profits made in the new lands, pursuant to earlier agreements. Because he had been relieved of his duties as governor, the crown did not feel bound by these contracts, and his demands were rejected. After his death his family later sued for part of the profits from trade with <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in the pleitos colombinos.

On May 20, 1506, at about the age of 55, <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> died in <LOCATION>Valladolid</LOCATION>, fairly wealthy from the gold his men had accumulated in <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION>. When he died he was still convinced that his journeys had been along the east coast of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION>. According to a study, published in February 2007, by <PERSON>Antonio Rodriguez Cuartero</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Department of Internal Medicine of the University of Granada</ORGANIZATION>, he died of a heart attack caused by <PERSON>Reiter</PERSON>'s Syndrome (also called reactive arthritis). According to his personal diaries and notes by contemporaries, the symptoms of this illness (burning pain during urination, pain and swelling of the knees, and conjunctivitis of the eyes) were clearly visible in his last three years.

His remains were first buried in <LOCATION>Valladolid</LOCATION> and then at the monastery of <LOCATION>La Cartuja</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> (southern <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>), by the will of his son <PERSON>Diego</PERSON>, who had been governor of <LOCATION>Hispaniola</LOCATION>. Then in 1542, his remains were transferred to <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION>, in eastern Hispaniola. In 1795, the French took over <PERSON>Hispaniola</PERSON>, and his remains were moved to <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION>. After <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> became independent following the Spanish-American War in 1898, his remains were moved back to the Cathedral of <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, where they were placed on an elaborate catafalque. However, a lead box bearing an inscription identifying "<PERSON>Don Christopher Columbus</PERSON>" and containing fragments of bone and a bullet was discovered at <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION> in 1877. 

To lay to rest claims that the wrong relics were moved to <LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION> and that the remains of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> were left buried in the cathedral of <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION>, DNA samples were taken in June 2003 (History Today August 2003). The results are not conclusive. Initial observations suggested that the bones did not appear to belong to somebody with the physique or age at death associated with <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. DNA extraction proved difficult; only a few limited fragments of mitochondrial DNA could be isolated. However, such as they are, these do appear to match corresponding DNA from <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s brother, giving support to the idea that the two had the same mother and that the body therefore may be that of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>. The authorities in <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION> have not allowed the remains there to be exhumed, so it is unknown if any of those remains could be from <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s body. The location of the <LOCATION>Dominican</LOCATION> remains is in the "Columbus Lighthouse" or Faro A Colon which is in <LOCATION>Santo Domingo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Dominican Republic</LOCATION>.



Sometimes thought of erroneously as the discoverer of the New World, <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> was preceded by the various cultures and civilizations of the indigenous peoples of the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>, as well as the Western world's <ORGANIZATION>Vikings</ORGANIZATION>. He is regarded more accurately as the person who brought the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION> into the forefront of Western attention. "Columbus' claim to fame isn't that he got there first," explains historian <PERSON>Martin Dugard</PERSON>, "it's that he stayed." Equally false is the notion that he was first to envision a rounded earth. This was known in ancient times, though largely forgotten in the Middle Ages. By <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON>'s day, educated men were in agreement as to its spherical shape, even if many or most people believed otherwise. More contentious was the size of the earth, and whether it was possible in practical terms to cross such a vast body of water: the longest any ship (European or otherwise) had gone without making landfall did not much exceed 30 days when <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> embarked on his first audacious voyage.

<PERSON>Amerigo Vespucci</PERSON>'s travel journals, published 1502-4, convinced <PERSON>Martin Waldseemller</PERSON> that the discovered place was not <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>, as <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON> always believed, but a new continent, and in 1507, a year after <PERSON>Columbus</PERSON>' death, <PERSON>Waldseemller</PERSON> published a world map calling the new continent <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> from <PERSON>Vespucci</PERSON>'s Latinized name "Americus". 

Historically, the British had downplayed <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> and emphasized the role of <PERSON>John Cabot</PERSON> as a pioneering explorer. But for the emerging <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Cabot</PERSON> made a poor national hero. Veneration of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> dates back to colonial times. America itself was sometimes referred to as <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>. The use of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> as a founding figure of New World nations and the use of the word <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> spread rapidly after the American Revolution. During the last two decades of the 18th century the name "<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>" was given to the federal capital <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>'s new capital city, <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, the <LOCATION>Columbia River</LOCATION>, and numerous other places. Attempts to rename the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> "<ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION>" failed, but <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> became a female national personification of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, similar to the male Uncle <PERSON>Sam</PERSON>. Outside the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> the name was used in 1819 for the Republic of <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>, a precursor of the modern nation of <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>.

A candidate for sainthood in the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> in 1866, Celebration of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' legacy perhaps reached a zenith in 1892 when the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION> occurred. Monuments to Columbus like the Columbian Exposition in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> were erected throughout the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> extolling him. Numerous cities, towns, counties, and streets have been named after him, including the capital cities of two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> states (<LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>). 

In 1909, descendants of <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION> undertook to dismantle the Columbus family chapel in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and move it to a site near <LOCATION>State College</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, where it may now be visited by the public. At the museum associated with the chapel, there are a number of Columbus relics worthy of note, including the armchair which the "Admiral of the Ocean Sea" used at his chart table.

Culpability is sometimes placed on contemporary governments and their citizens for the hardship suffered by Native Americans during the time of <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>. Columbus myths and celebrations are generally a positive affair, making less room for this concept in history books. <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> was strongly criticised in a song by Jamaican artiste Burning Spear titled 'A Damn Blasted Liar.' The controversial song opened a strong opinionated debate across much of the <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> region on the effects that <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> and his leadership had on the region's native peoples.

The Spanish colonization of the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>, and the subsequent effects on the native peoples, were dramatized in the 1992 feature film  to commemorate the 500th anniversary of his landing in the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>. *In 2003, Venezuelan President <PERSON>Hugo Chvez</PERSON> urged Native American Latin Americans to not celebrate the Columbus Day holiday. <PERSON>Chavez</PERSON> blamed <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> for leading the way in the mass genocide of the Native Americans by the Spanish.

Although an abundance of artwork involving <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> exists, no authentic contemporary portrait has been found. There is a portrait painted by <PERSON>Alejo Fernndez</PERSON>, between 1505 and 1536, titled <ORGANIZATION>Virgen de los Navegantes</ORGANIZATION> in the Royal <PERSON>Alcazar</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Seville</LOCATION>. At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, 71 alleged portraits of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> were displayed, most did not match contemporary descriptions. These writings describe him as having reddish hair, which turned to white early in his life, light colored eyes, as well as being a lighter skinned person with too much sun exposure turning his face red. 

In keeping with descriptions of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> having had auburn hair or (later) white hair, textbooks use the Sebastiano del Piombo painting (which in its normal-sized resolution shows <ORGANIZATION>Columbus</ORGANIZATION>'s hair as auburn) so often that it has become the iconic image of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> accepted by popular culture.

<PERSON>Colombus</PERSON> is a significant historical figure and has been depicted in fiction and in popular films and television. 

In 1991, author <PERSON>Salman Rushdie</PERSON> published a fictional representation of <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> in The New Yorker, "<PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Queen Isabella</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> Consummate Their Relationship, <LOCATION>Santa Fe</LOCATION>, January, 1492," (The New Yorker, June 17, 1991, p. 32). In  (1996) science fiction novelist <PERSON>Orson Scott Card</PERSON> focuses on Columbus' life and activities, but the novel's action also deals with a group of scientists from the future who travel back to the 15th century with the goal of changing the pattern of European contact with the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>. British author <PERSON>Stephen Baxter</PERSON> includes <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>' quest for royal sponsorship as a crucial historical event in his 2007 science fiction novel Navigator (ISBN 978-0-441-01559-7), the third entry in the author's Time's Tapestry Series. American author <PERSON>Mark Twain</PERSON> based the time traveller's trick in A <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut Yankee</ORGANIZATION> in King Arthur's Court on <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>'s sucessful prediction of a lunar eclipse on his fourth voyage to the new world.

Columbus has also been portrayed in cinema and television, including mini-series, films and cartoons. Most notably he was portrayed by <PERSON>Grard Depardieu</PERSON> in 1992 film by <PERSON>Ridley Scott</PERSON> . <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> presented <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> as an idealist as opposed to the view that he was ruthless and responsible for the misfortune of Native Americans. As in many of <PERSON>Scott</PERSON>'s movies, the character is presented as having some ideas that weren't current at his time. 

Other more recent productions include TV mini-series <ORGANIZATION>Christopher Columbus</ORGANIZATION> (1985) with <PERSON>Gabriel Byrne</PERSON> as <PERSON>Colombus</PERSON>, , a 1992 biopic film by <PERSON>Alexander Salkind</PERSON>, <PERSON>Christopher Columbus</PERSON>, a 1949 film starring <PERSON>Fredric March</PERSON> as <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, and comedy Carry On <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> (1992).













<TITLE><PERSON>Billy Crystal</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>William Edward</PERSON> "Billy" Crystal (born March 14, 1948) is an <ORGANIZATION>American Golden Globe</ORGANIZATION> Award-nominated and Emmy Award-winning actor, writer, producer, comedian, and film director. He gained prominence in the 1970s for playing <PERSON>Jodie Dallas</PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> sitcom Soap and became a Hollywood film star during the late 1980s and 1990s, appearing in the box office successes When <PERSON>Harry Met Sally</PERSON>... and <ORGANIZATION>City Slickers</ORGANIZATION>. 

Crystal was born in the Doctor's <LOCATION>Hospital</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> and grew up in <LOCATION>Long Beach</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, the son of <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> (ne <PERSON>Gabler</PERSON>), a housewife, and <PERSON>Jack Crystal</PERSON>, a record company executive and producer of jazz records, who owned and operated the Commodore Record store. His uncle was musician and songwriter <PERSON>Milt Gabler</PERSON>, and his brother, <PERSON>Richard Crystal</PERSON>, is a television producer. Crystal grew up in a Jewish family that he has described as "large" and "loving". After graduation from <ORGANIZATION>Long Beach High School</ORGANIZATION>, Crystal attended <ORGANIZATION>Marshall University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Huntington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION>, on a baseball scholarship, having learned the game from his father, who pitched for <ORGANIZATION>St. John's University</ORGANIZATION>. Crystal never played a game at <ORGANIZATION>Marshall</ORGANIZATION> because the program was suspended during his freshman year and he didn't return as a sophomore, staying back in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> with his future wife. Later, he attended <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Nassau Community College</ORGANIZATION>. 

Crystal has been married to <PERSON>Janice Goldfinger</PERSON>, whom he met when he was 18 and she 17, since 1970. They have two daughters, actresses <PERSON>Jennifer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lindsay</PERSON>, and are now grandparents. They reside in <LOCATION>Pacific Palisades</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.

Crystal returned to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and performed regularly at The Improv and Catch a Rising Star. He studied film and television direction under <PERSON>Martin Scorsese</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION>. Crystal's earliest prominent role was as <PERSON>Jodie Dallas</PERSON> on Soap, one of the first gay characters portrayed on American television. In 1976, Crystal appeared on an episode of All in the Family. He was scheduled to appear on the first episode of Saturday Night Live (October 11, 1975), but his sketch was cut. He did do a stand-up bit later on that first season as "Bill Crystal", on the April 17, 1976, episode. After hosting a show years later, in 1984, he joined the cast. His most famous recurring sketch was his parody of <PERSON>Fernando Lamas Fernando</PERSON>, a smarmy talk show host whose catch phrase, "You look... mahvelous!," became a media sensation.

Crystal's first film role was in <PERSON>Joan Rivers</PERSON>'s 1978 film Rabbit Test. Crystal also made game show appearances such as The Hollywood Squares and The $20,000 Pyramid. He holds the record for getting his contestant partner to the top of the pyramid in the bonus round in the fastest time, 26 seconds. 

Crystal hosted the Academy Awards broadcast in 1990-1993, 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2004; and he reportedly turned down the opportunity to host the 2006 ceremony to concentrate on his one-man show, 700 Sundays. His eight times as the emcee is second only to legendary Oscar host <PERSON>Bob Hope</PERSON> in most ceremonies hosted.

Crystal appeared briefly in <PERSON>Rob Reiner</PERSON>'s 1984 "rockumentary" This Is Spinal Tap as Morty The Mime, a waiter dressed as a mime at one of Spinal Tap's parties. He shared the scene with a then-unknown, non-speaking <PERSON>Dana Carvey</PERSON>. Crystal's memorable line in the film was "Mime is money." Eventually, <PERSON>Reiner</PERSON> directed Crystal again in The Princess Bride, and then in the romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally..., for which Crystal was nominated for a Golden Globe. Crystal also appeared in the box-office hit City Slickers (1991).

<PERSON>Crystal</PERSON> wrote, directed, and starred in Mr. Saturday Night (1992) and Forget <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> (1995). In the former, <ORGANIZATION>Crystal</ORGANIZATION> played a serious role in aging makeup, as an egotistical comedian who reflects back on his career. He directed the made-for-television movie 61* (2001) based on <PERSON>Roger Maris</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Mickey Mantle</PERSON>'s race to break Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s single-season home run record in 1961. This earned <ORGANIZATION>Crystal an Emmy</ORGANIZATION> nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special.

Crystal has continued working in film, including the popular Analyze This (1999) and Analyze That (2002) with <PERSON>Robert De Niro</PERSON>. Crystal lent his voice to the character <PERSON>Mike Wazowski</PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION>Pixar</ORGANIZATION>'s animated feature film Monsters, <ORGANIZATION>Inc.</ORGANIZATION>, and in the English version of Howl's Moving Castle as the voice of Calcifer. <ORGANIZATION>Pixar</ORGANIZATION> originally approached him to provide the voice of Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story. He turned down that offer, but regretted it after the film became one of the most popular releases of the year.

Crystal won the 2005 Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event for 700 Sundays, a two-act, one-man play, which he conceived and wrote about his parents and his childhood growing up on <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION>. He toured the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> with the show in 2006 and <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> in 2007.

Following the initial success of the play, <ORGANIZATION>Crystal</ORGANIZATION> wrote the book 700 Sundays for <ORGANIZATION>Warner Books</ORGANIZATION>, which was published on October 31, 2005. In conjunction with the book and the play that also paid tribute to his uncle, <PERSON>Milt Gabler</PERSON>, Crystal produced two CD compilations: Billy Crystal Presents: The <PERSON>Milt Gabler Story</PERSON>, which featured his uncle's most influential recordings from Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" to "Rock Around the Clock" by <PERSON>Bill Haley</PERSON> & His Comets; and <PERSON>Billy Remembers Billie</PERSON> featuring <ORGANIZATION>Crystal</ORGANIZATION>'s favorite Holiday recordings.

In 1986, Crystal started hosting Comic Relief on <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON>Robin Williams</PERSON> and <PERSON>Whoopi Goldberg</PERSON>. Founded by <PERSON>Bob Zmuda</PERSON>, Comic Relief raises money for homeless people in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>.

On September 6, 2005, on The Tonight Show, Crystal and <PERSON>Jay Leno</PERSON> were the first celebrities to sign a <ORGANIZATION>Harley-Davidson</ORGANIZATION> motorcycle to be auctioned off for <LOCATION>Gulf Coast</LOCATION> relief.

Crystal has also participated in the <ORGANIZATION>Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>. Portraying himself in a video, <ORGANIZATION>Crystal</ORGANIZATION> introduces museum guests to the genealogy wing of the museum.

On March 12, , <ORGANIZATION>Crystal</ORGANIZATION> signed a minor league contract, for a single day, to play with the <ORGANIZATION>New York Yankees</ORGANIZATION>, and was invited to the team's major league spring training. <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> wore uniform number 60, in honor of his upcoming 60th birthday. On March 13, in a spring training game against the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Pirates</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Crystal</ORGANIZATION> led off as the designated hitter. He managed to make contact, fouling a fastball up the first base line, but was eventually struck out by <ORGANIZATION>Pirates</ORGANIZATION> pitcher <PERSON>Paul Maholm</PERSON> on 6 pitches and was later replaced in the batting order by <PERSON>Johnny Damon</PERSON>. He was released on March 14, his 60th birthday.

In addition to his Golden Globe Award-nominations, Emmy Awards, and Tony Award, Crystal is the 2007 recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.













<TITLE><PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON></TITLE>

In 1954, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> began his career as one of the first performers of rockabilly, an uptempo fusion of country and rhythm and blues with a strong back beat. His novel versions of existing songs, mixing "black" and "white" sounds, made him popular--and controversial--as did his uninhibited stage and television performances. He recorded songs in the rock and roll genre, with tracks like "Hound Dog" and "Jailhouse Rock" later embodying the style. Presley had a versatile voice and had unusually wide success encompassing other genres, including gospel, blues, ballads and pop. To date, he has been inducted into four music halls of fame.

In the 1960s, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> made the majority of his thirty-one movies--mainly poorly reviewed, but financially successful, musicals. In 1968, he returned with acclaim to live music in a television special, and thereafter performed across the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>, notably in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>. Throughout his career, he set records for concert attendance, television ratings and recordings sales. He is one of the best-selling and most influential artists in the history of popular music. Health problems, drug dependency and other factors led to his premature death at age 42.

<PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON> was of mixed ancestry. His father, <PERSON>Vernon</PERSON> (April 10, 1916-June 26, 1979), had several low-paying jobs, including sharecropper and truck driver. His mother, <PERSON>Gladys Love Smith</PERSON> (April 25, 1912 - August 14, 1958) worked as a sewing machinist. They met in <LOCATION>Tupelo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>, and eloped to <LOCATION>Pontotoc County</LOCATION> where they married on June 17, 1933.

Presley's ancestry is discussed at the following sites:

Presley was born in a two-room shotgun house, built by his father, in <LOCATION>East Tupelo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>. He was an identical twin--his brother was stillborn and given the name <PERSON>Jesse Garon</PERSON>. Growing up as an only child he "was, everyone agreed, unusually close to his mother." The family lived just above the poverty line and attended an Assembly of God church. <PERSON>Vernon</PERSON> has been described as "a malingerer, always averse to work and responsibility." His wife was "voluble, lively, full of spunk" and had a fondness for drink. In 1938, <PERSON>Vernon</PERSON> was jailed for an eight dollar check forgery. His incarceration caused <PERSON>Gladys</PERSON> and her son to lose the family home, and they had to move in with relatives.

In September 1942, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> entered first grade at <ORGANIZATION>Lawhorn School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tupelo</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was sometimes bullied; classmates threw "things at him--rotten fruit and stuff--because he was different... he stuttered and he was a mama's boy." Despite this, he was considered a "well-mannered and quiet child".

On October 3, 1945, at age ten, he made his first public performance in a singing contest at the <LOCATION>Mississippi-Alabama</LOCATION> Fair and Dairy Show at the suggestion of his teacher Mrs. <PERSON>J.C. Grimes</PERSON>. Dressed as a cowboy, the young <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> had to stand on a chair to reach the microphone and sang <PERSON>Red Foley</PERSON>'s "Old Shep." He came second, winning $5 and a free ticket to all the Fair rides.

In 1946, for his eleventh birthday, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> received his first guitar. He had wanted a bicycle or rifle for his birthday, but his parents could only afford a guitar. Over the following year, <PERSON>Vernon</PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON>Vester</PERSON>, gave <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> basic guitar lessons. In September 1948, the family moved to <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, allegedly because Vernon--in addition to needing work--had to escape the law for transporting bootleg liquor. In 1949, they lived at <ORGANIZATION>Lauderdale Courts</ORGANIZATION>, a public housing development in one of <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>' poorer sections. Presley practiced playing guitar in the laundry room and also played in a five-piece band with other tenants. Another resident, <PERSON>Johnny Burnette</PERSON>, recalled, "Wherever <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> went he'd have his guitar slung across his back... [H]e'd go in to one of the cafes or bars... Then some folks would say: 'Let's hear you sing, boy.'" Presley enrolled at <ORGANIZATION>L. C. Humes High School</ORGANIZATION> where some fellow students viewed his performing unfavorably; one recalled that he was "a sad, shy, not especially attractive boy" whose guitar playing was not likely to win any prizes. Presley was made fun of as a 'trashy' kind of boy, playing 'trashy' hillbilly music." Other children however, "would beg him" to sing, but he was apparently too shy to perform.

In September 1950, Presley occasionally worked evenings as an usher at <LOCATION>Loew</LOCATION>'s State Theater--his first job--to boost the family income, but his mother made him quit as she feared it was affecting his school work. He worked again at <LOCATION>Loew</LOCATION>'s in June the following year, but was fired after a fistfight over a female employee. He began to grow his sideburns and, when he could afford to, dress in the wild, flashy clothes of <ORGANIZATION>Lansky Brothers</ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION>Beale Street</LOCATION>. He stood out, especially in the conservative Deep South of the 1950s, and was mocked and bullied for it. Childhood friend <PERSON>Red West</PERSON> said: "In the sea of 1600 pink-scalped kids at school, <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> stood out like a camel in the arctic. ... [but] ... his appearance expressed a defiance which his demeanor did not match..." Despite any unpopularity or shyness, he was a contestant in his school's 1952 "Annual Minstrel Show" and won by receiving the most applause. His prize was to sing encores, including "Cold Cold Icy Fingers" and "Till I Waltz Again With You".

After graduation, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was still rather shy, a "kid who had spent scarcely a night away from home". His third job was driving a truck for the <ORGANIZATION>Crown Electric Company</ORGANIZATION>. He began wearing his hair longer with a "ducktail"--the style of truck drivers at that time.

Initial influences came through his family's attendance at the Assembly of God, a Pentecostal Holiness church. <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> wrote: "Gospel pervaded <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>' character and was a defining and enduring influence all of his days." Throughout his life--in the recording studio, in private, or after concerts--<PERSON>Presley</PERSON> joined with others singing and playing gospel music at informal sessions.

The young Presley frequently listened to local radio; his first musical hero was family friend <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> Slim, a hillbilly singer with a radio show on Tupelos WELO. Presley performed occasionally on Slims Saturday morning show, <PERSON>Singin</PERSON> and Pickin Hillbilly. "He was crazy about music... Thats all he talked about," recalls his sixth grade friend, <PERSON>James Ausborn</PERSON>, Slims younger brother. Before he was a teenager, music was already Presleys "consuming passion". <PERSON>J. R. Snow</PERSON>, son of 1940s country superstar <PERSON>Hank Snow</PERSON>, recalls that even as a young man <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> knew all of <PERSON>Hank Snows</PERSON> songs, "even the most obscure". Presley himself said: "I loved records by Sister <PERSON>Rosetta Thorpe</PERSON>, ... <PERSON>Roy Acuff</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ernest Tubbs</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ted Daffan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jimmie Rodgers</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jimmy Davis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bob Wills</PERSON>."

In <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> went to record stores that had jukeboxes and listening booths, playing old records and new releases for hours. He was an audience member at the all-night white--and black--"gospel sings" downtown. Memphis Symphony Orchestra concerts at <LOCATION>Overton Park</LOCATION> were another Presley favorite, along with the Metropolitan Opera. His small record collection included <PERSON>Mario Lanza</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dean Martin</PERSON>. Presley later said, "I just loved music. Music period."

<LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> had a strong tradition of blues music and Presley went to blues as well as hillbilly venues. Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African American composers and recording artists, including <PERSON>Arthur Crudup</PERSON>, <PERSON>Rufus Thomas</PERSON> and <PERSON>B.B. King</PERSON>. King says that he "knew <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> before he was popular. He used to come around and be around us a lot ... on Beale Street."

Presley "was an untrained musician who played entirely by ear. 'I don't read music,' he confessed, 'but I know what I like.' ... Because he was not a songwriter, Presley [would] rarely [have] material prepared for recording sessions..." When later, as a young singer, he "ventured into the recording studio he was heavily influenced by the songs he had heard on the jukebox and radio."

On July 18, 1953, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION>Sun Records' Memphis Recording Service</ORGANIZATION> to record "My Happiness" with "That's When Your Heartaches Begin", supposedly a present for his mother. During his initial introduction at <ORGANIZATION>Sun Records</ORGANIZATION>, assistant <PERSON>Marion Keisker</PERSON> asked him who he sounded like. Presley replied: "I don't sound like nobody." On January 4, 1954, he cut a second acetate. At the time, Sun Records boss <PERSON>Sam Phillips</PERSON> was on the lookout for someone who could deliver a blend of black blues and boogie-woogie music; he thought it would be very popular among white people. When <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> acquired a demo recording of "Without Love (There Is Nothing)" and was unable to identify the vocalist, <PERSON>Keisker</PERSON> reminded him about the young truck driver. She called him on June 26, 1954. Presley was not able to do justice to the song (though he would record it years later). <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> would later recall that "<PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> was probably as nervous as anybody, black or white, that I had seen in front of a microphone." Despite this, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> invited local musicians <PERSON>Winfield</PERSON> "Scotty" <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bill Black</PERSON> to audition Presley. Though they were not overly impressed, a studio session was planned.

During a recording break, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> began "acting the fool" first with <PERSON>Arthur Crudup</PERSON>'s "That's All Right (Mama)". <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> quickly got them all to restart, and began taping. This was the sound he had been looking for. The group recorded other songs, including <PERSON>Bill Monroe</PERSON>'s "Blue Moon of <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>". After the session, according to <PERSON>Scotty Moore</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bill Black</PERSON> remarked: "Damn. Get that on the radio and they'll run us out of town".

"That's All Right" was aired on July 8, 1954, by <PERSON>DJ Dewey Phillips</PERSON>. Listeners to the show began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. (The DJ mispronounced Presley's apparently unusual name as "<PERSON>Elton Preston</PERSON>.") The interest was such that <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> played the demo fourteen times. During an interview on the show, <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> asked Presley what high school he attended--to clarify <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>'s color for listeners who assumed he must be black. The first release of Presley's music featured "That's All Right" and "Blue Moon of <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION>". With Presley's version of <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON>'s song consistently rated higher,both sides began to chart across the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Black</PERSON> began playing regularly with Presley. They gave performances on the July 17 and July 24, 1954 to promote the Sun single at the <ORGANIZATION>Bon Air</ORGANIZATION>, a rowdy music club in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, where the band was not well-received. On July 30 the trio, billed as <ORGANIZATION>The Blue Moon Boys</ORGANIZATION>, made their first paid appearance at the <ORGANIZATION>Overton Park Shell</ORGANIZATION>, with <PERSON>Slim Whitman</PERSON> headlining. A nervous Presley's legs were said to have shaken uncontrollably during this show: his wide-legged pants emphasized his leg movements, apparently causing females in the audience to go "crazy". <PERSON>Scotty Moore</PERSON> claims it was just the natural way he moved and had nothing to do with "nerves." Presley consciously incorporated similar movements into future shows.

DJ and promoter <PERSON>Bob Neal</PERSON> became the trio's manager (replacing <PERSON>Scotty Moore</PERSON>). <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> and <PERSON>Black</PERSON> left their band, the Starlight Wranglers and, from August through October 1954, appeared with Presley at <ORGANIZATION>The Eagle</ORGANIZATION>'s Nest. Presley debuted at the Grand Ole Opry in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> on October 2; <PERSON>Hank Snow</PERSON> introduced Presley on stage. He performed "Blue Moon of <ORGANIZATION>Kentucky</ORGANIZATION>" but received only a polite response. Afterwards, the singer was allegedly told by the Opry's <PERSON>Jim Denny</PERSON>: "Boy, youd better keep driving that truck.", though others deny it was <PERSON>Denny</PERSON> who made that statement.Country music promoter and manager <PERSON>Tillman Franks</PERSON> booked Presley for the <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> Hayride on October 16. Before <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> saw Presley, he referred to him as "that new black singer with the funny name". During Presley's first set, the reaction was muted; <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> then advised <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> to "Let it all go!" for the second set. House drummer <PERSON>D.J. Fontana</PERSON> (who had worked in strip clubs) complemented Presley's movements with accented beats. <PERSON>Bill Black</PERSON> also took an active part in encouraging the audience, and the crowd became more responsive.

According to one source, regarding Presley's engagements from that time, "Audiences had never before heard [such] music... [or] seen anyone who performed like Presley either. The shy, polite, mumbling boy gained self-confidence with every appearance... People watching the show were astounded and shocked, both by the ferocity of his performance, and the crowds reaction to it... <PERSON>Roy Orbison</PERSON> saw Presley for the first time in <LOCATION>Odessa</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>: 'His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing... I just didnt know what to make of it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it.'" <PERSON>Sam Phillips</PERSON> said <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> "put every ounce of emotion ... into every song, almost as if he was incapable of holding back."

By August 1955, <ORGANIZATION>Sun Studios</ORGANIZATION> had released ten sides credited to "Elvis Presley, <PERSON>Scotty</PERSON> and Bill", all typical of the developing Presley style. That style proved hard to categorize; he was billed or labeled in the media as "The King of Western Bop", "The Hillbilly Cat" and "The Memphis Flash".

On August 15, 1955, "Colonel" <PERSON>Tom Parker</PERSON> became Presley's manager, signing him to a one year contract, plus renewals. Several record labels had shown interest in signing Presley and, by the end of October 1955, three major labels had made offers up to $25,000. On November 21, 1955, <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> negotiated a deal with <ORGANIZATION>RCA Victor Records</ORGANIZATION> to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000, $5,000 of which was a bonus for the singer for back royalties owed to him by <ORGANIZATION>Sun Records</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>Presley</LOCATION>, at 20, was officially still a minor, so his father had to sign the contract). By December 1955, RCA had begun to heavily promote its newest star, and by the month's end had re-released all of his Sun recordings.

On January 10, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> made his first recordings for RCA in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>. The session produced "Heartbreak Hotel/I Was The One" which was released on January 27. The public reaction to "Heartbreak Hotel" prompted RCA to release it as a single in its own right (February 11). By April it had hit number one in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> charts, selling in excess of one million copies. 

To increase the singer's exposure, <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> finally brought Presley to national television (In March 1955, Presley had failed an audition for <PERSON>Arthur Godfrey</PERSON>'s Talent Scouts). He booked six <ORGANIZATION>Dorsey Brothers</ORGANIZATION>' Stage Show appearances in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>, beginning January 28, 1956. Presley was introduced on the first by <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> DJ <PERSON>Bill Randle</PERSON>. He stayed in town and on January 30, he and the band headed for the <ORGANIZATION>RCA</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>New York Studio</LOCATION>. The sessions yielded eight songs, including "My Baby Left Me" and "Blue Suede Shoes". The latter was the only hit single from the collection, but the recordings marked the point at which Presley started moving away from the raw, pure Sun sound to the more commercial and mainstream sound RCA had envisioned for him.

On March 23, RCA <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> released <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON>, his first album. Like the Sun recordings, the majority of the tracks were country songs. The album went on to top the pop album chart for 10 weeks.

On April 1, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> launched his acting career with a screen-test for <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Pictures</ORGANIZATION>. His first motion-picture, Love Me Tender, was released on November 21 (See 'Acting career').

Colonel <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> had also obtained a deal for two lucrative shows with <PERSON>Milton Berle</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>. Presley first appeared on The <PERSON>Milton Berle</PERSON> Show from the deck of the USS Hancock in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> on April 3. His performance was cheered by a live audience of appreciative sailors and their dates. A few days after, a flight taking Presley's band to <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> for a recording session left all three badly shaken (the plane lost an engine and almost went down over <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>). After more hectic touring, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> returned to The <PERSON>Milton Berle</PERSON> Show on June 5 and performed "Hound Dog" (without his guitar). Singing the song uptempo, he then began a slower version. His exaggerated, straight-legged shuffle around the microphone stand stirred the audience--as did his vigorous leg shaking and hip thrusts in time to the beat. Presley's "gyrations" created a storm of controversy--even eclipsing the 'communist threat' headlines prevalent at the time. The press described his performance as "vulgar" and "obscene". The furore was such that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was pressured to explain himself on the local <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> TV show <PERSON>Hy Gardner</PERSON> Calling: "Rock and roll music, if you like it, and you feel it, you can't help but move to it. That's what happens to me. I have to move around. I can't stand still. I've tried it, and I can't do it." After this performance he was dubbed "Elvis the Pelvis". Presley disliked the name, calling it "one of the most childish expressions I ever heard."

From April 23, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was scheduled to perform four weeks at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the <LOCATION>Las Vegas Strip</LOCATION>--billed this time as "the Atomic Powered Singer" (Since <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> was the home of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>'s atomic weapons testing, <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> thought the name would be catchy). His shows were so badly received by critics and the conservative, middle-aged guests, that Colonel <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> cut short the engagement from four weeks to two. . <PERSON>D.J. Fontana</PERSON> said, "I don't think the people there were ready for Elvis..... We tried everything we knew. Usually <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> could get them on his side. It didn't work that time". While in <LOCATION>Vegas</LOCATION>, Presley saw <ORGANIZATION>Freddie Bell</ORGANIZATION> and the Bellboys live, and liked their version of <PERSON>Leiber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stoller</PERSON>'s "Hound Dog". By May 16, he had added the song to his own act.

The <PERSON>Berle</PERSON> shows drew such huge ratings that <PERSON>Steve Allen</PERSON> (NBC), not a fan of rock and roll, booked him for one appearance in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on July 1. <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> wanted "to do a show the whole family can watch" and introduced a "new Elvis" in white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang "Hound Dog" for less than a minute to a Basset Hound in a top hat. According to one author, "<PERSON>Allen</PERSON> thought Presley was talentless and absurd... [he] set things up so that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> would show his contrition..." In his book "Hi-Ho Steverino!" <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> wrote the following: "When I booked <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>, I naturally had no interest in just presenting him vaudeville-style and letting him do his spot as he might in concert. Instead we worked him into the comedy fabric of our program. We certainly didn't inhibit <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>' then-notorious pelvic gyrations, but I think the fact that he had on formal evening attire made him, purely on his own, slightly alter his presentation. The day after (July 2), the single "Hound Dog" was recorded and <PERSON>Scotty Moore</PERSON> said they were "all angry about their treatment the previous night". (Presley often referred to the <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.) A few days later, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> made a "triumphant" outdoor appearance in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> at which he announced: "You know, those people in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> is like tonight."

Country vocalists The <ORGANIZATION>Jordanaires</ORGANIZATION> accompanied Presley on The <PERSON>Steve Allen</PERSON> Show and their first recording session together produced "Any Way You Want Me", "Don't Be Cruel" and "Hound Dog". The Jordanaires would work with the singer through the 1960s.

Though Presley had been unhappy, <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>'s show had, for the first time, beaten The Ed Sullivan Show in the ratings, causing a critical <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> (CBS) to book Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.

Presley's first <PERSON>Ed Sullivan</PERSON> appearance (September 9, 1956) was seen by some 55-60 million viewers. Biographer <PERSON>Greil Marcus</PERSON> has written: "Compared to moments on the <PERSON>Dorsey</PERSON> shows and on the <PERSON>Berle</PERSON> show, it was ice cream." On the third <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> show, in spite of Presley's established reputation as a "gyrating" performer, he sang only slow paced ballads and a gospel song. <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was nevertheless only shown to the television audience 'from the waist up', as if to censor the singer. <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> claims he "stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl", and was shot in close up during this last broadcast, as if <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> had tried to 'bury' the singer, It was also claimed that Colonel <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> had himself orchestrated the 'censorship' merely to generate publicity. In spite of any misgivings about the controversial nature of his performing style (see 'Sex symbol'), <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> declared at the end of the third appearance that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was "a real decent, fine boy" and that they had never had "a pleasanter experience" on the show.

On December 4, Presley dropped into <ORGANIZATION>Sun Records</ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON>Carl Perkins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerry Lee Lewis</PERSON> were recording. <PERSON>Sam Phillips</PERSON> made sure the session of the three performing was recorded; the results would later appear on a bootlegged recording titled ''The Million Dollar Quartet'' in 1977 (<PERSON>Johnny Cash</PERSON> is often thought to have performed with the trio, but he was only present briefly at <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON>' instigation for a photo opportunity). RCA would eventually iron out legal difficulties and release an authorized version a few years later.

On December 29, Billboard revealed that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> had placed more songs in the Top 100 than any other artist since chart records began. This news was followed by a front page report in the Wall Street Journal on December 31, that suggested Presley merchandise had grossed more than $22 million in sales.

When "That's All Right" was played, many listeners were sure Presley must be black, prompting white disc-jockeys to ignore his Sun singles. However, black disc-jockeys did not want anything to do with any record they knew was made by a white man. To many black adults, Presley had undoubtedly "stolen" or at least "derived his style from the Negro rhythm-and-blues performers of the late 1940s", , though such criticism ignored Presley's use of "white" musical styles. Some black entertainers, notably <PERSON>Jackie Wilson</PERSON>, argued: "A lot of people have accused <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> of stealing the black mans music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>."

By the spring of 1956, Presley was becoming popular nationwide and teenagers flocked to his concerts. <PERSON>Scotty Moore</PERSON> recalled: "Hed start out, 'You aint nothin but a Hound Dog,' and theyd just go to pieces. Theyd always react the same way. Thered be a riot every time." <PERSON>Bob Neal</PERSON> wrote: "It was almost frightening, the reaction... from [white] teenage boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him." In <LOCATION>Lubbock</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, a teenage gang fire-bombed Presley's car. Some performers became resentful (or resigned to the fact) that Presley's unmatched hustle onstage before them would "kill" their own act; he thus rose quickly to top billing. At the two concerts he performed at the 1956 <LOCATION>Mississippi-Alabama</LOCATION> Fair and Dairy Show, one hundred National Guardsmen were on hand to prevent crowd trouble.

To many white adults, the singer was "the first rock symbol of teenage rebellion. ... they did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-Negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." In 1956, a critic for the <ORGANIZATION>New York Daily News</ORGANIZATION> wrote that popular music "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley" and the Jesuits denounced him in its weekly magazine, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. Even <PERSON>Frank Sinatra</PERSON> opined: "His kind of music is deplorable, a rancid smelling aphrodisiac. It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people." Presley responded to this (and other derogatory comments <PERSON>Sinatra</PERSON> made) by saying: "I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it... This ... [rock and roll] ... is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago."

Presley was even seen as a "definite danger to the security of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>." His actions and motions were called "a strip-tease with clothes on" or "sexual self-gratification on stage." They were compared with "masturbation or riding a microphone." Some saw the singer as a sexual pervert, and psychologists feared that teenaged girls and boys could easily be "aroused to sexual indulgence and perversion by certain types of motions and hysteria--the type that was exhibited at the Presley show." Presley would insist, however, that there was nothing vulgar about his stage act, saying: "Some people tap their feet, some people snap their fingers, and some people sway back and forth. I just sorta do em all together, I guess." In August 1956, a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> judge called Presley a "savage" and threatened to arrest him if he shook his body while performing in <LOCATION>Jacksonville</LOCATION>. The judge declared that Presley's music was undermining the youth of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. Throughout the performance (which was filmed by police), he kept still as ordered, except for wiggling a finger in mockery at the ruling. (Presley recalls this incident during the '68 Comeback Special.)

In 1957, despite Presley's demonstrable respect for "black" music and performers, he faced accusations of racism. He was alleged to have said in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>: "The only thing Negro people can do for me is to buy my records and shine my shoes." Presley always denied saying, or ever wanting to say, such a racist remark. Jet magazine, run by and for African Americans, was subsequently keen to investigate the story. The singer's acquaintances in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> were pursued for any other racist anecdotes to back up the perception that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was racist, but none was found. Nor could any evidence be found of the date, location and persons involved when the remark was allegedly made (Presley had never visited <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>). However, the Jet journalist did find plenty of testimony that Presley judged people "regardless of race, color or creed". Even forty-five years later, the alleged remark was still being quoted as if it were a verified fact, to Presley's detriment.

His parents moved home in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, but the singer lived there briefly. With increased concerns over privacy and security, <PERSON>Graceland</PERSON> was bought and renovated in 1957, a mansion with several acres of land. This was Presley's primary residence until his death.

Presley's record sales grew quickly throughout the late 1950s, with hits like "All Shook Up", "(Let me Be Your) Teddy Bear" and "Too Much".

On December 20, 1957, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> received his draft notice. <PERSON>Hal Wallis</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Pictures</ORGANIZATION> had already spent $350,000 on the film King Creole, and did not want to suspend or cancel the project. The <ORGANIZATION>Memphis Draft Board</ORGANIZATION> granted Presley a deferment to finish it. On March 24, 1958, he was inducted as <ORGANIZATION>US Army</ORGANIZATION> private #53310761 and completed basic training at <LOCATION>Fort Hood</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> on September 17, 1958, before being posted to <LOCATION>Friedberg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> with the 3rd Armored Division, where his service took place from October 1, 1958 until March 2, 1960.

Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's down-to-earth nature, and his generosity while in service. To supplement meager under-clothing supplies, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit. He also donated his <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> pay to charity, and purchased all the TV sets for personnel on the base at that time.

Presley had chosen not to join 'Special Services', which would have allowed him to avoid certain duties and maintain his public profile. He continued to receive massive media coverage, with much speculation echoing <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>'s own concerns about his enforced absence damaging his career. However, early in 1958, RCA <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> producer <PERSON>Steve Sholes</PERSON> and <PERSON>Freddy Bienstock</PERSON> of <PERSON>Hill</PERSON> and Range (Presley's main music publishers) had both pushed for recording sessions and strong song material, the aim being to release regular hit recordings during Presley's two-year hiatus. Hit singles--and six albums--duly followed during that period.

As Presley's fame grew, his mother continued to drink excessively and began to gain weight. She had wanted her son to succeed, "but... [the] hysteria of the crowd frightened her." In early August 1958, doctors had diagnosed hepatitis and her condition worsened. Presley was granted emergency leave to visit her, arriving in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> on August 12. Two days later, <PERSON>Gladys Presley</PERSON> died of heart failure, aged forty-six. <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was distraught, "grieving almost constantly" for days.

Some months later, in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>, "[a] sergeant had introduced [Presley] to amphetamines when they were on maneuvers at Grafenwhr... it seemed like half the guys in the company were taking them." Friends around Presley, like <PERSON>Joe Esposito</PERSON>, also began taking them, "if only to keep up with <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>, who was practically evangelical about their benefits." The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> also introduced Presley to karate--something which he studied seriously, even including it in his later live performances.

<PERSON>Presley</PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> on March 2, 1960, and was honorably discharged with the rank of sergeant on March 5. Any doubts <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> had about his popularity must have been dispelled as "The train which carried him from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> was mobbed all the way, with <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> being called upon to appear ... at whistle-stops" to placate his fans. 

The first recording session, on March 20, 1960, was attended by all of the significant businessmen involved with Presley; none had heard him sing for two years, and there were inevitable concerns about him being able to recapture his previous success. The session was the first at which Presley was recorded using a three-track machine, allowing better quality, postsession remixing and stereophonic recording. This, and a further session in April, yielded some of Presley's best-selling songs. "It's Now or Never" ended with Presley "soaring up to an incredible top G sharp ... pure magic." His voice on "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" has been described as "natural, unforced, dead in tune, and totally distinctive." Although some tracks were uptempo, none could be described as "rock and roll", and many of them marked a significant change in musical direction. Most tracks found their way on to an album--Elvis is Back!--described by one critic as "a triumph on every level... It was as if <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> had... broken down the barriers of genre and prejudice to express everything he heard in all the kinds of music he loved". The album was also notable because of Homer Boots <PERSON>Randolph</PERSON>'s acclaimed saxophone playing on the blues songs "Like A Baby" and "Reconsider Baby", the latter being described as "a refutation of those who do not recognize what a phenomenal artist Presley was."

In 1956, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> launched his career as a film actor. He screen-tested for <ORGANIZATION>Paramount Pictures</ORGANIZATION> by lip-synching "Blue Suede Shoes" and performing a scene as '<PERSON>Bill Starbuck</PERSON>' in ''The Rainmaker''. Despite being quietly confident that The Rainmaker would be his first film--even going as far as saying so in an interview--the role eventually went to <PERSON>Burt Lancaster</PERSON>.

After signing a seven-year contract with Paramount, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> made his big-screen dbut with the musical western, Love Me Tender. It was panned by the critics but did well at the box office.The original title--The <ORGANIZATION>Reno Brothers</ORGANIZATION>--was changed to capitalize on the advanced sales of the song "Love Me Tender". The majority of Presley's films were musical comedies made to "sell records and produce high revenues." He also appeared in more dramatic films, like Jailhouse Rock and King Creole. The erotic, if not homoerotic, dance sequence to the song "Jailhouse Rock", which Presley choreographed himself, "is considered by many as his greatest performance ever captured on film." To maintain box office success, he would later even shift "into beefcake formula comedy mode for a few years." He also made one non-musical western, Charro!.

<PERSON>Presley</PERSON> stopped live performing after his Army service with the exception, ironically--given <PERSON>Sinatra</PERSON>'s previously scathing criticism--of a guest appearance on  (1960). He also performed three charity concerts--two in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION>Pearl Harbor</LOCATION> (1961).

In the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> had said on many occasions that "more than anything, he wanted to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor." His manager, with an eye on long-term earnings, negotiated a multi-picture seven-year contract with <PERSON>Hal Wallis</PERSON>. The singer would later star alongside several established or up-coming actors, including <PERSON>Walter Matthau</PERSON>, <PERSON>Carolyn Jones</PERSON>, <PERSON>Angela Lansbury</PERSON>, <PERSON>Charles Bronson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Barbara Stanwyck</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mary Tyler Moore</PERSON>--and even a very young <PERSON>Kurt Russell</PERSON> in his screen debut. Although <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was praised by directors, like <PERSON>Michael Curtiz</PERSON>, as polite and hardworking (and as having an exceptional memory), "he was definitely not the most talented actor around." Others were more charitable; critic <PERSON>Bosley Crowther</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> said: "This boy can act," about his portrayal in King Creole. Director <PERSON>Joe Pasternak</PERSON> believed "Elvis should be given more meaty parts. ... He would be a good actor. He should do more important pictures."

The movies he did make, and the <ORGANIZATION>AIP</ORGANIZATION> beach movies (which were mainly made for an early sixties teenage audience), were generally criticized as a "pantheon of bad taste." The scripts of his movies "were all the same, the songs progressively worse." For <PERSON>Blue Hawaii</PERSON>, "fourteen songs were cut in just three days." <PERSON>Julie Parrish</PERSON>, who appeared in Paradise, <LOCATION>Hawaiian Style</LOCATION>, says that Presley hated many of the songs chosen for his films; he "couldn't stop laughing while he was recording" one of them. Others noted that the songs seemed to be "written on order by men who never really understood <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> or rock and roll." However, several reputable songwriters/partnerships contributed soundtrack songs, including <PERSON>Jerry Leiber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mike Stoller</PERSON>, <PERSON>Don Robertson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sid Tepper</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roy C. Bennett</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Otis Blackwell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Winfield Scott</PERSON>. Whatever the quality of the material, some observers have argued that Presley generally sang well in the studio, with commitment, and always played with distinguished musicians and backing singers. Sight and Sound wrote that in his movies "<PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON>, aggressively bisexual in appeal, knowingly erotic, [was] acting like a crucified houri and singing with a kind of machine-made surrealism." Critics would later claim that "No major star suffered through more bad movies than <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON>."

Presley movies were nevertheless very popular, and he "became a film genre of his own." <PERSON>Hal Wallis</PERSON> would later remark: "An <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON> picture is the only sure thing in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>." <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> on celluloid was the only chance for his world-wide fans to see him, in the absence of live appearances (the only time he toured outside of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> was in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> in 1957). His Blue <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> even "boosted the new state's tourism. Some of his most enduring and popular songs came from those [kind of] movies," like "Can't Help Falling in Love," "Return to Sender" and "Viva Las Vegas." His 1960s films and soundtracks grossed some $280 million. On December 1, 1968, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> wrote: "Three times a year Elvis Presley ... [makes] multimillion-dollar feature-length films, with holiday titles like "Blue <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>", "Fun in <LOCATION>Acapulco</LOCATION>", "Viva Las Vegas", "Tickle Me", "Easy Come, Easy Go", "Live a Little, Love a Little" and the latest in the series, "Chataqua" [released as Charro!]. For each film <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> receives a million dollars in wages and 50 per cent of the profits. ... [E]very film yields an LP sound-track record which may sell as many as two-million copies."

In 1964, <PERSON>Richard Burton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter O'Toole</PERSON> had starred in <PERSON>Hal Wallis</PERSON>' acclaimed <PERSON>Becket</PERSON>. <PERSON>Wallis</PERSON> admitted to the press that the financing of such quality productions was only possible by making a series of profitable B-movies starring Presley. He branded <PERSON>Wallis</PERSON> "a double-dealing sonofabitch" (and he thought little better of <PERSON>Tom Parker</PERSON>), realizing there had never been any intention to let him develop into a serious actor.

<PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was similarly exploited the following year with the film Tickle Me. Allied Artists had serious financial problems and hoped a Presley film would help them "stay afloat". By agreeing to a lower fee, using previously recorded songs and filming on the studio back-lot, Allied Artists were able to keep costs very low. Considered one of the weakest of all Presley pictures, it became the third highest grossing picture in Allied Artists' history, and saved them from bankruptcy at the time.

Presley was one of the highest paid actors during the 1960s, but times were changing. "[The] <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON> film was becoming pass. Young people were tuning in, dropping out and doing acid. Musical acts like <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Airplane</ORGANIZATION>, Grateful Dead, The Doors, <PERSON>Janis Joplin</PERSON> and many others were dominating the airwaves. <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON> was not considered cool as he once was." <PERSON>Priscilla Presley</PERSON> recalls: "He blamed his fading popularity on his humdrum movies" and "... loathed their stock plots and short shooting schedules." She also notes: "He could have demanded better, more substantial scripts, but he didn't."

Change of Habit (1969) was the singer's final movie role. His last two films were concert documentaries in the early 1970s, though Presley was keen to consider dramatic movie roles. (See: 'Influence of Colonel <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and others').

As well as the formulaic movie songs of the 1960s, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> added to the studio recordings of Elvis Is Back, by recording other noteworthy songs like "She's Not You", "Suspicion," "Little Sister", "(You're the) Devil in Disguise" and "It Hurts Me." In 1966 he recorded a cover of <PERSON>Bob Dylan</PERSON>'s "Tomorrow is a Long Time" (which RCA <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> relegated to a bonus track on the soundtrack album for Spinout). He also produced two gospel albums: His Hand in Mine (1960) and How Great Thou Art (1966). In 1967, he recorded some well-received singles, like <PERSON>Guitar Man</PERSON>, by songwriter/guitar player <PERSON>Jerry Reed</PERSON>. However, "during the Beatles era (1963-70), only six <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> singles reached number ten or better. 'Suspicious Minds' was the lone number one."

During filming of Paradise, Hawaiian Style, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> returned to his Bel Air home. The Beatles were at the end of their second <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tour. Colonel <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> had been negotiating a meeting for some time, through The Beatles' manager <PERSON>Brian Epstein</PERSON>, though <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> simply saw it as a valuable publicity opportunity (He had apparently even tried to get the group and Presley to perform the closing song in the same movie, but The Beatles' film contract precluded it). The group arrived in Bel Air amid a flurry of elaborate security arrangements made by <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> at 10pm, on August 27, 1965. The visit lasted about four hours. Many of Presley's closest and trusted friends-- members of the so-called "Memphis Mafia"--were present, including school friend and bodyguard <LOCATION>Red West</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Marty Lacker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jerry Schilling</PERSON>, <PERSON>Larry Geller</PERSON> and their girlfriends, etc..

Biographer <PERSON>Peter Guralnick</PERSON> maintains that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was at best "lukewarm" about playing host to people he did not really know, and it took a while for everyone to feel comfortable. <PERSON>Paul McCartney</PERSON> later said: "It was one of the great meetings of my life. I think he liked us. I think at that time, he may have felt a little bit threatened, but he didn't say anything. We certainly didn't feel any antagonism. I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."

<PERSON>Marty Lacker</PERSON> recalls <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> saying: "'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts." The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. "They all went to the piano," says <PERSON>Lacker</PERSON>, "and <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs, <PERSON>Chuck Berry</PERSON> songs. <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> played <PERSON>Paul</PERSON>'s bass part on "I Feel Fine", and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"

<PERSON>Ringo Starr</PERSON> played pool with two others that night; <PERSON>George Harrison</PERSON> "looked to most of the guys to be stoned" on arrival and allegedly smoked a joint with <PERSON>Larry Geller</PERSON> and talked about <LOCATION>Hinduism</LOCATION> (see: 'Influence of Colonel <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and others'). <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> played roulette with <PERSON>Epstein</PERSON>. However, <PERSON>Guralnick</PERSON> claims The Beatles were, overall, disappointed by the visit. They still reciprocated with an invitation for <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> to visit them, but only some of Presley's "Memphis Mafia" accepted. "<PERSON>John Lennon</PERSON> went out of his way to tell <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> [<PERSON>Schilling</PERSON>] how much the evening had meant to him" and asked <PERSON>Schilling</PERSON> to tell Presley, "'[I]f it hadn't been for him I would have been nothing.'" <PERSON>Schilling</PERSON> says that when he told Presley he did not say anything, but "just kind of smiled."(See: '19701972)').

Presley's sexual appeal and photogenic looks have been acknowledged. Director <PERSON>Steve Binder</PERSON>, not a fan of Presley's music at the time, recalled from the '68 Comeback Special: "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence."

According to <PERSON>Marjorie Garber</PERSON>, a "male rock critic writing in 1970 praised <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> as 'The master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl.' ... rumor had it that into his skin-tight jeans was sewn a lead bar to suggest a weapon of heroic proportions." She cites a boyhood friend of <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>'s who claims the singer actually used a cardboard toilet roll tube to make it "look to the girls up front like he had one helluva thing there inside his pants."  <PERSON>Ed Sullivan</PERSON> had apparently heard similar rumors and instructed his director <PERSON>Marlo Lewis</PERSON> to film only Presley's chest and head for his final <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> appearance. However, <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> was skeptical about Presley wearing such a device and says simply: "It wasn't there".

Accounts of Presley's numerous sexual conquests may be exaggerated. <PERSON>Cybill Shepherd</PERSON> reveals that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> kissed her all over her naked body - but refused to have oral sex with her. Ex-Girlfriends <PERSON>Judy Spreckels</PERSON> and June Juanico had no sexual relationships with <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>. <PERSON>Byron Raphael</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alanna Nash</PERSON> have stated that the star "would never put himself inside one of these girls..." <PERSON>Cassandra Peterson</PERSON> ("Elvira") says she knew Presley for only one night, but all they did was talk. <PERSON>Cher</PERSON> regrets turning him down when he asked her to stay with him in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, because she was too nervous of spending the night with him.  <PERSON>Peggy Lipton</PERSON> claims that he was "virtually impotent" with her, but she attributed this to his boyishness and drug misuse. <PERSON>Guralnick</PERSON> concurs with others, "he wasn't really interested", preferring to lie in bed, watch television and talk.

<PERSON>Ann-Margret</PERSON> (Presley's co-star in <LOCATION>Viva Las Vegas</LOCATION>) refers to <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> as her "soulmate" but has revealed little else. A publicity campaign about Presley and <PERSON>Margret</PERSON>'s romance was launched during the filming of <LOCATION>Viva Las Vegas</LOCATION>, which helped to increase <PERSON>Margret</PERSON>'s popularity. Presley apparently dated many female co-stars for publicity purposes. <PERSON>Lori Williams</PERSON> dated him for a while in 1964. She says their "courtship was not some bizarre story. It was very sweet and <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> was the perfect gentleman."

Former partner <PERSON>Linda Thompson</PERSON> says they did not consummate their relationship until after a few months of dating. After they broke up in December 1976, many say Presley never had sex again. His last girlfriend, <PERSON>Ginger Alden</PERSON> claims to be engaged to Presley at the time of his death, though her story is contradicted by many of Presley's close friends.



<PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON> met in 1959 at a party in <LOCATION>Bad Nauheim</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> during his stay in the army. She was 14 at the time they met, while he was 24. They quickly began a serious relationship and frequently visited each other until he left <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> in 1960.

<PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON> and <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> stayed in contact over the phone, though they would not see each other again until the summer of 1962, when <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON>'s parents agreed to let her visit for two weeks. After another visit at Christmas, <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON>'s parents finally let her move to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> for good. Part of the agreement was that she would be privately educated, to complete her senior year, and live with <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>' father and his wife, <PERSON>Dee</PERSON>, in their home--due to <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>'s difficulty with accepting his stepmother, he arranged for them to live in a separate house on the Graceland estate. However, it wasn't long until <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON> was moved into Graceland to live with <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>. 

In her autobiography, <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> and Me, <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON> says that <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> refused to have sex with her until they were married. However, biographer <PERSON>Suzanne Finstad</PERSON> writes that <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON> and <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> slept together on their second date. 

Shortly before Christmas 1966, Presley proposed to <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON>. They married on May 1, 1967 at the Aladdin Hotel in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>. In typical fashion, Colonel <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> had arranged a photo session and press conference to be conducted shortly after the ceremony. According to <PERSON>Finstad</PERSON>, this marriage was part of a mastermind for fame hatched by <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON> and her mother.

Their only child, <PERSON>Lisa Marie</PERSON>, was born on February 1, 1968.

By 1967, Colonel <PERSON>Tom Parker</PERSON> had negotiated a contract that gave him 50% of Presley's earnings. <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>'s excessive gambling--and his subsequent need to have <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> signed up to commercially lucrative contracts--may well have adversely affected the course of Presley's career. <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>'s concerns about his own <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizenship may have also been a factor in <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and the singer never exploiting Presley's popularity abroad (see: '19731976'). It has been claimed that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>'s original band was fired in order to isolate the singer: <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> wanted no one close to Presley to suggest that a better management deal might exist.

As well as signing Presley to RCA <PERSON>Victor</PERSON>, <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> also cut a deal with <PERSON>Hill</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Range Publishing Company</ORGANIZATION> to create a separate entity-- "Elvis Presley Music Incorporated"--to handle all of <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>'s songs and accrued royalties. <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> would later use this set-up to make songwriters relinquish some of their royalties; this ultimately resulted in the better writers refusing to provide songs for Presley, causing a marked decline in the quality of his output over the years.Presley apparently disliked several songs--even some of the earliest top sellers he became famous for (which suggests commercial influences were sometimes greater than his own desires). Presley's friend <PERSON>Jerry Schilling</PERSON> relates that one way to really annoy the singer was to play a song, like "All Shook Up", on a jukebox at one of his private parties. "Get that crap off," was his typical reaction.

In 1969, record producer Chips <PERSON>Moman</PERSON> and Presley recorded with <PERSON>Moman</PERSON>'s own musicians at his <ORGANIZATION>American Sound Studios</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>. Given the control exerted by RCA and the music publishers, this was a significant departure. <PERSON>Moman</PERSON> still had to deal with <PERSON>Hill</PERSON> and Range staff on site and was not happy with their song choices. <PERSON>Moman</PERSON> could only get the best out of the singer when he threatened to quit the sessions and asked Presley to remove the "aggravating" publishing personnel from the studio. RCA <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> executive <PERSON>Joan Deary</PERSON> was later full of praise for the song choices and superior results of <PERSON>Moman</PERSON>'s work, like "In the Ghetto" and "Suspicious Minds", but despite this, no producer was to override <PERSON>Hill</PERSON> and Range's control again.

According to life-long friend and "Memphis Mafia" member <PERSON>George Klein</PERSON>, over the years <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was offered lead roles in the film Midnight Cowboy and in West Side Story. <PERSON>Robert Mitchum</PERSON> personally offered him the lead in Thunder Road. In 1974, Barbra Streisand approached Presley to star with her in the remake of A Star is Born. In each case, any ambitions the singer may have had to play such parts were thwarted by his manager's negotiating demands, or his flat refusals.

<PERSON>Marty Lacker</PERSON> regarded <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> as a "hustler and scam artist" who abused Presley's trust, but <PERSON>Lacker</PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> was a master promoter. <PERSON>Priscilla Presley</PERSON> noted that "Elvis detested the business side of his career. He would sign a contract without even reading it."

Presley's father in turn distrusted <PERSON>Lacker</PERSON> and the other members of the "Memphis Mafia"; he thought they collectively exercised an unhealthy influence over his son. "[I]t was no wonder" that as the singer "slid into addiction and torpor, no one raised the alarm: to them, <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> was the bank, and it had to remain open." Musician <PERSON>Tony Brown</PERSON> noted the urgent need to reverse Presley's declining health as the singer toured in the mid-1970s. "But we all knew it was hopeless because <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> was surrounded by that little circle of people... all those so-called friends and... bodyguards."

<PERSON>Larry Geller</PERSON> became Presley's hairdresser in 1964. Unlike others in the "Memphis Mafia", <PERSON>Geller</PERSON> was interested in 'spiritual studies', and was subsequently viewed with suspicion and scorn by the singer's manager and friends. From their first conversation, <PERSON>Geller</PERSON> recalls how <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> revealed his secret thoughts and anxieties, how "there's got to be a reason... why I was chosen to be <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON>.'" He then poured out his heart in "an almost painful rush of words and emotions," telling <PERSON>Geller</PERSON> about his mother and the hollowness of his Hollywood life, things he could not share with anyone around him. Thereafter, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> voraciously read books <PERSON>Geller</PERSON> supplied, on religion and mysticism. Perhaps most tellingly, he revealed to <PERSON>Geller</PERSON>: "I swear to God, no one knows how lonely I get and how empty I really feel." Presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life, taking trunkloads of books with him on tour.

Presley showed interest in many beliefs, including Mormonism. A Book of Mormon owned by Presley (containing notes allegedly written by the singer) was given to <PERSON>Alan Osmond</PERSON> after his death, and is now said to be in the church's archives in <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION> (A second copy may have been given to Presley by <PERSON>Mormon Ed Parker</PERSON>, a karate instructor). However, <PERSON>Linda Thompson</PERSON>, Presley's girlfriend after his separation, notes: "[H]e really followed the bible and he also was on a spiritual quest to find out how other people of other faiths lived their lives... he used to wear an Egyptian ankh, a star of <PERSON>David</PERSON> and a crucifix around his neck. And when people would say are you confused, he would say, no, not at all. I just don't want to miss heaven on a technicality."

In 1968, even Presley's version of <PERSON>Jerry Reed</PERSON>'s hook-laden "Guitar Man" had failed to enter the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Top 40. He continued to issue movie soundtrack albums that sold poorly compared to those of films like Blue <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> from 1961. It had also been nearly six years since the single "Good Luck Charm" had topped the Billboard Hot 100.

Presley was, by now, "profoundly" unhappy with his career. Colonel <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>'s plans once again included television, and he arranged for Presley to appear in his own special. The singer had not been on television since <PERSON>Frank Sinatra</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Timex</ORGANIZATION> special in May of 1960.. <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> shrewdly manoeuvred a deal with <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Tom Sarnoff</PERSON> which included the network's commitment to financing a future Presley feature film--something that <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> had found increasingly difficult to secure.

The special was made in June, but was first aired on December 3, 1968 as a Christmas telecast called simply <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>. Later dubbed the '68 Comeback Special by fans and critics, the show featured some lavishly staged studio productions. Other songs however, were performed live with a band in front of small audience--Presley's first live appearance as a performer since 1961. The live segments saw Presley clad in black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style--reminiscent of his rock and roll days. <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> called it "a performance of emotional grandeur and historical resonance." <PERSON>Jon Landau</PERSON> in Eye magazine remarked: "There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made <PERSON>Jim Morrison</PERSON> green with envy." Its success was helped by director and co-producer, <PERSON>Steve Binder</PERSON>, who worked hard to reassure the nervous singer and to produce a show that was not just an hour of Christmas songs, as Colonel <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> had originally planned.

By January, 1969, one of the key songs written specifically for the special, "If I Can Dream", reached number 12.. The soundtrack of the special also broke into the Top 10. On December 4, when the TV ratings were released, <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> had captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. It was the network's number one rated show that season.

<PERSON>Jerry Schilling</PERSON> recalls: "The '68 special inspired <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>; reminding him what he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack. What he had to wear. He was out of prison, man." <PERSON>Steve Binder</PERSON> said of Presley's reaction: "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, "<PERSON>Steve</PERSON>, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in."

Buoyed by the experience, Presley engaged in the prolific series of recording sessions at <ORGANIZATION>American Sound Studios</ORGANIZATION>, which lead to the acclaimed From Elvis in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> (Chips Moman was its uncredited producer). It was followed by From Memphis To Vegas/From Vegas To <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, a double-album. The same sessions lead to the hit singles "In the Ghetto", "Suspicious Minds", "Kentucky Rain" and "Don't Cry Daddy".

In 1969, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>, many new offers came in from around the world. The <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> Palladium wanted an "Elvis Spectacular" and offered <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> $28,000 for a one week engagement. He responded: "That's fine for me, now how much can you get for <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>?". By May, the brand new International Hotel in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> announced that it had booked Presley; he was scheduled to perform from July 31, after Barbra Streisand opened the new venue.

Presley duly delivered fifty-seven shows over four weeks at the hotel, which had the largest showroom in the city. He had assembled some of the finest musicians--including an orchestra--and some of the best soul/gospel back-up singers available..

Despite such a prestigious backing, Presley was nervous; he had last appeared in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> at the New Frontier Hotel in 1956 and it was considered a disaster. <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> subsequently promoted <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>' appearances all over <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>; he rented every available billboard and took out full-page advertisements in local and trade papers. The lobby of the International prominently displayed Presley souvenirs; records, T-shirts, straw boaters and stuffed animals. <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> wanted to make sure that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>'s return to the stage would be the show business event of the year, and hotel owner <PERSON>Kirk Kerkorian</PERSON> planned to send his own plane to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to fly in the rock press for the debut performance.

<PERSON>Presley</PERSON> took to the stage with no introduction. The audience--which included <PERSON>Pat Boone</PERSON>, Fats Domino, <PERSON>Wayne Newton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Dick Clark</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ann-Margret</PERSON>, <PERSON>George Hamilton</PERSON>, <PERSON>Angie Dickinson</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Henry Mancini</PERSON>--gave him a standing ovation before he sang one note. After a successful performance, he returned to give an encore, of "Can't Help Falling in Love", and received his third standing ovation. Backstage, many celebrities and well-wishers, including <PERSON>Cary Grant</PERSON>, congratulated Presley on his triumphant return which, in the showroom alone, had generated over $1,500,000 in revenues.

Newsweek commented: "There are several unbelievable things about <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars." <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> magazine declared Presley to be "supernatural, his own resurrection", while Variety proclaimed him a "superstar". At a press conference after his opening show, when a reporter referred to him as "The King", Presley pointed to Fats Domino, standing at the back of the room. "No," he said, "thats the real king of rock and roll."

The next day, <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>'s negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at a salary of $1 million per year.



In January 1970, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> returned to the International Hotel for a month-long engagement, performing two shows a night. RCA recorded some shows and the best material appeared on the album . In late February, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> performed six more attendance-breaking shows at the <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> Astrodome in Texas.In August at the <ORGANIZATION>International Hotel</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> filmed rehearsal and concert footage for a documentary: . He wore a jumpsuit--a garment that would become a trademark of Presley's live performances in the 1970s. Although he had new hit singles in many countries, some were critical of his song choices and accused him of being distant from trends within contemporary music.

Around this time Presley was threatened with kidnapping at the International Hotel. Phone calls were received, one demanding $50,000; if unpaid, Presley would be killed by a "crazy man". The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> took the threat seriously and security was stepped up for the next two shows. Presley went on stage with a Derringer in his right boot and a .45 in his waistband, but nothing untoward transpired. (The singer had had many threats of varying degrees since the fifties, many of them made without the singer's knowledge).

After closing his Las Vegas engagement on September 7, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> embarked on his first concert tour since 1958. Feeling exhausted, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> spent a month relaxing and recording before touring again in October and November. He would tour extensively in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> up to his death; many of the 1,145 concerts setting attendance records.

On December 21, 1970, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> met with President <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> at the White House (<LOCATION>Presley</LOCATION> arrived with a gift--a handgun. It was accepted but not presented for security reasons). <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> had engineered the encounter to express his patriotism, his contempt for the hippie drug culture and his wish to be appointed a "Federal Agent at Large". He also wished to obtain a <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs</ORGANIZATION> badge to add to similar items he had begun collecting. He offered to "infiltrate hippie groups" and claimed that <ORGANIZATION>The Beatles</ORGANIZATION> had "made their money, then gone back to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> where they fomented anti-American feeling." <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> was uncertain and bemused by their encounter, and twice expressed concern that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> needed to "retain his credibility". <PERSON>Ringo Starr</PERSON> later said he found it very sad to think Presley held such views. "This is Mr. <PERSON>Hips</PERSON>, the man, and he felt we were a danger. I think that the danger was mainly to him and his career." <PERSON>Paul McCartney</PERSON> said also that he "felt a bit betrayed ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [<PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."

On January 16, 1971 Presley was named 'One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation' by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce</ORGANIZATION> (The Jaycees). That summer, the City of <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> named part of Highway 51 South "<ORGANIZATION>Elvis Presley Boulevard</ORGANIZATION>", and he won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences</ORGANIZATION> (the organization that presents Grammy awards).

In April 1972, <ORGANIZATION>MGM</ORGANIZATION> again filmed Presley, this time for Elvis on Tour, which won a 1972 Golden Globe for Best Documentary. A fourteen-date tour started with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. RCA taped the shows for a live album. After the tour, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> released the 1972 single "Burning Love"--his last top ten hit in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> charts.

Off stage, Presley had continuing problems. His lifelong friend, <PERSON>Joe Esposito</PERSON>, said <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> "could never be true to any one woman." It was widely known that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> had several affairs during his 13-year union with <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON>, notably with <PERSON>Ann-Margret</PERSON>. In spite of his own infidelity, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was furious that <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON> was having an affair with a mutual acquaintance--<PERSON>Mike Stone</PERSON>, a karate instructor she had met in 1971 backstage at one of Presley's concerts. It was Presley himself who first suggested <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON> should take lessons from Stone. Once the news of their affair came to his attention, he raged obsessively: "There's too much pain in me... Stone [must] die." A bodyguard, <LOCATION>Red West</LOCATION>, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> decided: "Aw hell... Maybe it's a bit heavy..." The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972 and divorced on October 9, 1973, agreeing to share custody of their daughter.

Following his separation from <PERSON>Priscilla</PERSON>, he lived with <PERSON>Linda Thompson</PERSON>, a songwriter and one-time <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION> beauty queen, from July 1972 until just a few months before his death.

In January 1973, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> performed two charity concerts in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> for the <PERSON>Kui Lee</PERSON> cancer foundation. The first (January 12) was primarily a practice run for the main show which was broadcast live on January 14 (The first show also served as a backup if technical problems affected the live broadcast). The "Aloha from <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION>" concert was the world's first live concert satellite broadcast, reaching at least a billion viewers live and a further 500 million on delay. The show's album went to number one and spent a year in the charts. The album also proved to be Presley's last <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Number One album during his lifetime.

After his divorce in 1973, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> became increasingly isolated and overweight, with prescription drugs affecting his health, mood and his stage act. He overdosed twice on barbiturates, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first. According to Dr. <PERSON>George C. Nichopoulos</PERSON>, Presley's physician, the singer was "near death" in November of 1973 because of side effects of Demerol addiction. <PERSON>Nichopoulos</PERSON> notes that the hospital admission "was crazy", because of the enormous attention Presley attracted, and the measures necessary to protect his medical details. Lab technicians were even exploiting Presley's ill-health by selling samples of his blood and urine.

In his book, Elvis: The Final Years, <PERSON>Jerry Hopkins</PERSON> writes: "<PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>' health plummeted as his weight ballooned." At a <ORGANIZATION>University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION> concert on September 27 (1974), band members "had trouble recognizing him. ... 'He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody was scared.' Guitarist <PERSON>John Wilkinson</PERSON> ... recalled, ... 'He was all gut. He was slurring. ... It was obvious he was drugged, that there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad, the words to the songs were barely intelligible. ... We were in a state of shock.' "

Despite this, his "thundering" live version of "How Great Thou Art" won him a Grammy award in 1974. <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> won three competitive "Grammies" for his gospel recordings: "How Great Thou Art"--the album, as well as the single--and for the album He Touched Me (1972). (He had fourteen nominations during his career, though it has been claimed that "<PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> has never been adequately appreciated by those who give the Grammies.")

In April 1974, rumours began that he would actually be playing overseas after years of offers. A $1,000,000 bid came in from a source in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> for him to tour there, but Colonel <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> was uncharacteristically reluctant to accept such large sums. This prompted those closest to <LOCATION>Presley</LOCATION> to speculate about <PERSON>Parker</PERSON>'s past and circumstances, and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport to travel abroad. He scotched any notions Presley had of overseas work by citing poor security in other countries, and the lack of suitable venues for a star of his status. Presley apparently accepted such excuses, at the time.

Presley continued to play to sell-out crowds in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION>; a 1975 tour ended with a concert in <LOCATION>Pontiac</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION>, attended by over 62,000 fans. However the singer now had "no motivation to lose his extra poundage... he became self-conscious... his self-confidence before the audience declined... Headlines such as 'Elvis Battles Middle Age' and 'Time Makes Listless Machine of <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>' were not uncommon." According to <PERSON>Marjorie Garber</PERSON>, when <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> made his later appearances in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION>, he appeared "heavier, in pancake make-up... with an elaborate jewelled belt and cape, crooning pop songs to a microphone ... [He] had become <PERSON>Liberace</PERSON>. Even his fans were now middle-aged matrons and blue-haired grandmothers, ... Mother's Day became a special holiday for <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>' fans."

On July 13, 1976, Presley's father fired "<ORGANIZATION>Memphis Mafia</ORGANIZATION>" bodyguards <ORGANIZATION>Red West</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Sonny West</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Hebler</PERSON>. All three were taken by surprise, especially the <ORGANIZATION>Wests</ORGANIZATION>, who had been with Presley since the beginning of his career. <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was away in <LOCATION>Palm Springs</LOCATION> when it happened, and some suggest the singer was too cowardly to face them himself. <PERSON>Vernon Presley</PERSON> cited the need to "cut back on expenses" when dismissing the three, but <PERSON>David Stanley</PERSON> has claimed that the real reason was that the bodyguards were becoming more outspoken over Presley's drug dependency. A "trusted associate" of Presley, <PERSON>John O'Grady</PERSON>, also stated, in agreement with <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vernon Presley</PERSON>, that the bodyguards "were too rough with the fans... resulting in a lot of unnecessary lawsuits" and lawyers' fees. The Wests and <PERSON>Hebler</PERSON> would later write a devastating indictment of Presley in the book: Elvis: What Happened?, published August 1, 1977. (See: 'Final year and death').

Almost throughout the 1970s, RCA <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> had been increasingly concerned about making money from <LOCATION>Presley</LOCATION> material: they often had to rely on live recordings because of problems getting him to attend studio sessions. RCA <PERSON>Victor</PERSON>'s mobile studio was occasionally sent to Graceland in the hope of capturing an inspired vocal performance. Once in a studio, he could lack interest or be easily distracted; often this was linked to his health and drug problems.

In 2006, a journalist recalled: "<PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON> had [in 1977] become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self... he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts." In <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>, the singer was on stage for less than an hour and "was impossible to understand." In <LOCATION>Baton Rouge</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> failed to appear: he was unable to get out of his hotel bed, and the rest of the tour was cancelled.In <LOCATION>Knoxville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> on May 20, "there was no longer any pretense of keeping up appearances. The idea was simply to get <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> out on stage and keep him upright..." Despite his obvious problems, shows in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rapid City</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> were recorded for an album and a CBS-TV special: Elvis In Concert.

In <LOCATION>Rapid City</LOCATION>, "he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk... He was undoubtedly painfully aware of how he looked, and he knew that in his condition, he could not perform any significant movement." His performance in <LOCATION>Omaha</LOCATION> "exceeded everyone's worst fears... [giving] the impression of a man crying out for help..." According to <PERSON>Guralnick</PERSON>, fans "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his [spiritualism] books." A cousin, <PERSON>Billy Smith</PERSON>, recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat, recounting things like his favorite <PERSON>Monty Python</PERSON> sketches and his own past japes, but "mostly there was a grim obsessiveness... a paranoia about people, germs... future events", that reminded <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> of <PERSON>Howard Hughes</PERSON>.



The book Elvis: What Happened? was published just fifteen days before Presley's death. It was the first expos to detail Presley's years of drug misuse, and was apparently the authors' revenge for them being sacked and also a plea to get Presley to recognize the extent of his drug problems. The singer "was devastated by the book. Here were his close friends who had written serious stuff that would affect his life. He felt betrayed."

Presley's final performance was in <LOCATION>Indianapolis</LOCATION> at the Market Square Arena, on June 26, 1977. According to many of his entourage who accompanied him on tour, it was the "best show he had given in a long time" with "some strong singing".

Another tour was scheduled to begin August 17, 1977, but at Graceland the day before, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> was found on his bathroom floor by fiance, <PERSON>Ginger Alden</PERSON>. According to the medical investigator, Presley had "stumbled or crawled several feet before he died"; he had apparently been using the toilet at the time. Death was officially pronounced at 3:30 pm at the <ORGANIZATION>Baptist Memorial Hospital</ORGANIZATION>.

Before his funeral, hundreds of thousands of fans, the press and celebrities lined the streets and many hoped to see the open casket in Graceland. One of Presley's cousins, <PERSON>Bobby Mann</PERSON>, accepted $18,000 to secretly photograph the corpse; the picture duly appeared on the cover of the <ORGANIZATION>National Enquirer</ORGANIZATION>, making it the largest and fastest selling issue of all time. Two days after the singer's death, a car ploughed into a group of 2000 fans outside <LOCATION>Presley</LOCATION>'s home, killing two women and critically injuring a third. Among the mourners at the funeral were <PERSON>Ann-Margret</PERSON> (who had remained close to Presley) and his ex-wife. <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> issued a statement (See 'Legacy').

On Thursday, August 18, following a funeral service at Graceland, <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON> was buried at <LOCATION>Forest Hill Cemetery</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Memphis</LOCATION>, next to his mother. After an attempt to steal the body on August 28, and with no sign of security concerns at <LOCATION>Forest Hills</LOCATION> abating, his--and his mother's--remains were reburied at Graceland in the Meditation Garden in October.

Presley had developed many health problems during his life, some of them chronic. He started taking drugs (amphetamines) regularly in the army; it has also been claimed that pills of some form were first given to him by <PERSON>Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips</PERSON>. <PERSON>Priscilla Presley</PERSON> writes that by 1962, he was taking placidyls to combat severe insomnia in ever-increasing doses and later took Dexedrine to counter the sleeping pills' after-effects. She later saw "problems in Elvis' life, all magnified by taking prescribed drugs." Presley's physician, Dr. <PERSON>Nichopoulos</PERSON>, has said: "[<PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>] felt that by getting [pills] from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street. He... thought that as far as medications and drugs went, there was something for everything."

According to <PERSON>Guralnick</PERSON>: "[D]rug use was heavily implicated... no one ruled out the possibility of anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills... to which he was known to have had a mild allergy." In two lab reports filed two months later, each indicated "a strong belief that the primary cause of death was polypharmacy," with one report "indicating the detection of fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity." It appears he died of Combined Drug Intoxication.

The medical profession has been seriously questioned. Medical Examiner Dr. <PERSON>Jerry Francisco</PERSON> had publicly offered a cause of death while the autopsy was still being performed, but before toxicology results were known. Dr. <PERSON>Francisco</PERSON> dubiously stated that cardiac arrhythmia was the cause of death, a condition that can only be determined in a living person--not post mortem. Many doctors had been flattered to be associated with Presley (or had been bribed with gifts) and supplied him with pills, which simply fed his addictions. The singer allegedly spent at least $1 million annually during his latter years on drugs and doctors' fees or inducements. Although Dr. <PERSON>Nichopoulos</PERSON> was exonerated with regard to <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>'s death, "In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses of sedatives, amphetamines, and narcotics: all in <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>' name. On January 20, 1980, the board found [against] him... but decided that he was not unethical [because he claimed he'd been trying to wean the singer off the drugs]." His license was suspended. In July 1995, it was permanently revoked after it was found he had improperly dispensed drugs to several patients including <PERSON>Jerry Lee Lewis</PERSON>.

In 1994, the autopsy into Presley's death was re-opened. Coroner Dr. <PERSON>Joseph Davis</PERSON> declared: "There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs [i.e. drug overdose]. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack." However, there is little doubt that long-term drug abuse caused his premature death.



Author <PERSON>Samuel Roy</PERSON> has argued: "<PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>' death did occur at a time when it could only help his reputation. Just before his death, <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> had been forgotten by society."

Biographer <PERSON>Ernst Jorgensen</PERSON> has observed that when <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> died, it was as if all perspective on his musical career had been lost. His latter-day song choices had been seen as poor; many who disliked Presley had long been dismissive because he did not write his own songs. Others complained--incorrectly--that he could not play musical instruments. Such criticism of Presley continues. The tabloids had ridiculed his obesity and his kitschy, jump-suited performances. Comedian <PERSON>George Carlin</PERSON> remarked, "<LOCATION>America</LOCATION> got what it deserved in Elvis Presley: a big fat, drug-addicted squealer." <PERSON>Sade Adu</PERSON> said about Presley: "when I see him in his fifties movies, Jailhouse Rock and <PERSON>King Creole</PERSON>, that's an image I desire to look like. But when he's in his jumpsuit I just think of him as a drag queen." His sixties' film career was mocked. (In 1980, <PERSON>John Lennon</PERSON> said: "[Presley] died when he went into the army. That's when they killed him, that's when they castrated him.") Acknowledgment of his vocal style had been reduced to mocking the hiccuping, vocalese tricks that he had used on some early recordings--and to the way he said "Thankyouverymuch" after songs during live shows. This was only countered by the uncritical adulation of die-hard fans, who had even denied that he looked "fat" before he died. Any wish to understand <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON>--his genuine abilities and his real influence--"seemed almost totally obscured."

Presley has featured prominently in a variety of polls and surveys designed to measure popularity and influence. However, sociologist <PERSON>Philip Ennis</PERSON> writes: "Perhaps it is an error of enthusiasm to freight <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON> with too heavy a historical load" because, according to a opinion poll of high school students in 1957, <PERSON>Pat Boone</PERSON> was nearly the "two-to-one favorite over <PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON> among boys and preferred almost three-to-one by girls..." However, <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>'s early music and live performances are credited with helping to lay a commercial foundation which allowed established African American acts of the 1950s to receive due recognition. Performers like Fats Domino, <PERSON>Chuck Berry</PERSON> and <PERSON>Little Richard</PERSON>, came to national prominence after Presley's mix of musical styles was accepted among White American teenagers. Rather than Presley being seen as a white man who 'stole black music', <PERSON>Little Richard</PERSON> argued: "He was an integrator, <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music." <PERSON>Al Green</PERSON> agreed, saying; "He broke the ice for all of us." It has also been claimed that Presley's sound and persona helped to relax the rigid color line and thereby fed the fires of the civil rights movement.

In the late 1960s, composer and conductor <PERSON>Leonard Bernstein</PERSON> remarked: "Elvis is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century. He introduced the beat to everything, music, language, clothes, it's a whole new social revolution... the 60's comes from it."

Other celebrated pop and rock musicians have acknowledged that the young Presley inspired them. The Beatles were all big <LOCATION>Presley</LOCATION> fans. <PERSON>John Lennon</PERSON> said: "Nothing really affected me until I heard <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>. If there hadn't been an <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>, there wouldn't have been a Beatles." Deep Purple's <PERSON>Ian Gillan</PERSON> said: "For a young singer he was an absolute inspiration. I soaked up what he did like blotting paper... you learn by copying the maestro." <PERSON>Rod Stewart</PERSON> declared: "<PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> was the King. No doubt about it. People like myself, <PERSON>Mick Jagger</PERSON> and all the others only followed in his footsteps." <PERSON>Cher</PERSON> recalls from seeing <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> live in 1956 that he made her "realize the tremendous effect a performer could have on an audience." <PERSON>Bob Dylan</PERSON> said: "When I first heard <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>' voice I just knew that I wasn't going to work for anybody; and nobody was going to be my boss. Hearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail."

By 1958, singers obviously adopting Presley's style, like <PERSON>Marty Wilde</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cliff Richard</PERSON> (the so-called "British Elvis"), were rising to prominence in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION>. Elsewhere, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Johnny Hallyday</PERSON> and the Italians <PERSON>Adriano Celentano</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bobby Solo</PERSON> were also heavily influenced by <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>.

Presley's recorded voice is seen by many as his enduring legacy. Music critic <PERSON>Henry Pleasants</PERSON> writes: "<PERSON>Elvis Presley</PERSON> has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor. An extraordinary compass... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion. The voice covers two octaves and a third ... Moreover, he has not been confined to one type of vocal production. In ballads and country songs he belts out full-voiced high G's and A's that an opera baritone might envy. He is a naturally assimilative stylist with a multiplicity of voices--in fact, <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON>' is an extraordinary voice, or many voices." It has also been noted that "Presleys comprehensive musical knowledge and talent also surprised and impressed songwriters <PERSON>Jerry Leiber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mike Stoller</PERSON>... [They] considered Presley to be an 'idiot savant' because he knew so many songs. His knowledge of the blues especially impressed them. <PERSON>Leiber</PERSON> remembers that <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> "could imitate anything he heard. He had a perfect ear,"... Presley could sing and/or play a song on the piano after hearing it only once or twice. His natural ear for music, ability to play by ear, and to improvise were well known to his friends and musical associates."

Gospel tenor <PERSON>Shawn Nielsen</PERSON>, who sang backing vocals for Presley on tour, said: "He could sing anything. I've never seen such versatility... He had such great soul. He had the ability to make everyone in the audience think that he was singing directly to them. He just had a way with communication that was totally unique."

Presley's informal jamming in front of a small audience in the '68 Comeback Special is regarded as a forerunner of the so-called 'Unplugged' concept, later popularized by <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION>.

The singer has been inducted into four music 'Halls of Fame': the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1986), the Rockabilly Hall of Fame (1997), the Country Music Hall of Fame (1998), and the Gospel Music Hall of Fame (2001). In 1984, he received the W. C. Handy Award from the <ORGANIZATION>Blues Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and the Academy of Country Musics first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the American Music Awards first posthumous presentation of the Award of Merit.

Presley has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7080 <LOCATION>Hollywood Boulevard</LOCATION>. He was also honored by the <ORGANIZATION>Mississippi Blues Commission</ORGANIZATION> with a <ORGANIZATION>Mississippi Blues Trail</ORGANIZATION> historic marker placed in <LOCATION>Tupelo</LOCATION>, his birth place, in recognition of his contribution to the development of the blues in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION>.

In 1994, the 40th anniversary of Presley's "That's All Right" was recognized with its re-release, which made the charts worldwide, making top three in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION>.

During the 2002 World Cup a Junkie XL remix of his "A Little Less Conversation" (credited as "Elvis Vs JXL") topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of Presley's <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> number one hits, .

In the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> charts (January 2005), three re-issued singles again went to number one ("Jailhouse Rock", "One Night"/"I Got Stung" and "It's Now or Never"). Throughout the year, twenty singles were re-issued--all making top five.

In the same year, <ORGANIZATION>Forbes</ORGANIZATION> magazine named <PERSON>Presley</PERSON>, for the fifth straight year, the top-earning deceased celebrity, grossing US$45 million for the Presley estate during the preceding year. In mid-2006, top place was taken by <PERSON>Nirvana</PERSON>'s <PERSON>Kurt Cobain</PERSON> after the sale of his song catalogue, but <PERSON>Presley</PERSON> reclaimed the top spot in 2007.

<PERSON>Paul F. Campos</PERSON> has written: "The <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> cult touches on so many crucial nerves of American popular culture: the ascent of a workingclass boy from the most obscure backwater to international fame and fortune; the white man with the soul of black music in his voice; the performer whose music tied together the main strands of American folk music country, rhythm and blues, and gospel; and, perhaps most compellingly for a weight-obsessed nation, the sexiest man in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s gradual transformation into a fat, sweating parody of his former self, straining the bounds of a jewel-encrusted bodysuit on a Las Vegas stage. The images of fat <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> and thin <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> live together in the popular imagination." The singer continues to be imitated--and parodied--outside the main music industry and Presley songs remain very popular on the karaoke circuit. People from a diversity of cultures and backgrounds work as <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> impersonators ("the raw 1950s <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> and the kitschy 1970s <PERSON>Elvis</PERSON> are the favorites.")

In 2002, it was observed: 

















<TITLE><PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe</PERSON> (January 19, 1809  October 7, 1849) was an American poet, short-story writer, editor and literary critic, and is considered part of the American Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story and is considered the inventor of the detective-fiction genre. He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.

Born as <PERSON>Edgar Poe</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s parents died when he was young. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> was taken in by <PERSON>John</PERSON> and <PERSON>Frances Allan</PERSON>, of <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, but they never formally adopted him. After spending a short period at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> and briefly attempting a military career, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> and the Allans parted ways. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s publishing career began humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, <LOCATION>Tamerlane</LOCATION> and Other Poems (1827), credited only to "a Bostonian".

<PERSON>Poe</PERSON> switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move between several cities, including <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> in 1835, he married <PERSON>Virginia Clemm</PERSON>, his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> published his poem "The Raven" to instant success. His wife died of tuberculosis two years later. He began planning to produce his own journal, The <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> (later renamed The Stylus), though he died before it could be produced. On October 7, 1849, at age 40, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> died in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>; the cause of his death is unknown and has been attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs, heart disease, rabies, suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents.

<PERSON>Poe</PERSON> and his works influenced literature in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and around the world, as well as in specialized fields, such as cosmology and cryptography. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today.



Born <PERSON>Edgar Poe</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, on January 19, 1809, the second child of actress <PERSON>Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe</PERSON> and actor <PERSON>David Poe</PERSON>, Jr. He had an elder brother, <PERSON>William Henry Leonard Poe</PERSON>, and a younger sister, <PERSON>Rosalie Poe</PERSON>. <PERSON>Edgar</PERSON> may have been named after a character in <PERSON>William Shakespeare</PERSON>'s King <PERSON>Lear</PERSON>, a play the couple was performing in 1809. His father abandoned their family in 1810, and his mother died a year later from consumption. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> was then taken into the home of <PERSON>John Allan</PERSON>, a successful Scottish merchant in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, who dealt in a variety of goods including tobacco, cloth, wheat, tombstones, and slaves. The Allans served as a foster family but never formally adopted <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>, though they gave him the name "<PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe</PERSON>".

The <PERSON>Allan</PERSON> family had <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> baptized in the <ORGANIZATION>Episcopal Church</ORGANIZATION> in 1812. <PERSON>John Allan</PERSON> alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son. The family, including <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allan</PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON>Frances Valentine Allan</PERSON>, sailed to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> in 1815. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> attended the grammar school in <LOCATION>Irvine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> (where <PERSON>John Allan</PERSON> was born) for a short period in 1815, before rejoining the family in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in 1816. He studied at a boarding school in <LOCATION>Chelsea</LOCATION> until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend <ORGANIZATION>John Bransbys Manor House School</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Stoke Newington</LOCATION>, then a suburb four miles (6 km) north of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Poe</PERSON> moved back with the <LOCATION>Allans</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> in 1820. In March 1825, <PERSON>John Allan</PERSON>'s uncle and business benefactor <PERSON>William Galt</PERSON>, said to be one of the wealthiest men in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, died and left <PERSON>Allan</PERSON> several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000. By summer 1825, <PERSON>Allan</PERSON> celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick home named <LOCATION>Moldavia</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> may have become engaged to <PERSON>Sarah Elmira Royster</PERSON> before he registered at the one-year old <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> in February 1826 to study languages. The university, in its infancy, was established on the ideals of its founder, <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON>. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored. <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> had enacted a system of student self-government, the Honor System, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high drop-out rate. During his time there, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> lost touch with <PERSON>Royster</PERSON> and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> claimed that <PERSON>Allan</PERSON> had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. <PERSON>Allan</PERSON> did send additional money and clothes, but <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s debts increased. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> gave up on the university after a year, and, not feeling welcome in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, especially when he learned that his sweetheart <PERSON>Royster</PERSON> had married <PERSON>Alexander Shelton</PERSON>, he traveled to <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer. At some point he started using the pseudonym <PERSON>Henri Le Rennet</PERSON>.'''



Unable to support himself, on May 27, 1827, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION>United States Army</ORGANIZATION> as a private. Using the name "<PERSON>Edgar A. Perry</PERSON>", he claimed he was  even though he was 18. He first served at <LOCATION>Fort Independence</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Boston Harbor</LOCATION> for five dollars a month. That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry, <LOCATION>Tamerlane</LOCATION> and Other Poems, attributed with the byline "by a Bostonian". Only 50 copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s regiment was posted to <LOCATION>Fort Moultrie</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> and traveled by ship on the brig <LOCATION>Waltham</LOCATION> on November 8, 1827. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> was promoted to "artificer", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for artillery, and had his monthly pay doubled. After serving for two years and attaining the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank a noncommissioned officer can achieve), <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> sought to end his five-year enlistment early. He revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant <PERSON>Howard</PERSON>. <PERSON>Howard</PERSON> would only allow <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> to be discharged if he reconciled with <PERSON>John Allan</PERSON> and wrote a letter to <PERSON>Allan</PERSON>, who was unsympathetic. Several months passed and pleas to <PERSON>Allan</PERSON> were ignored; <PERSON>Allan</PERSON> may not have written to <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness. <PERSON>Frances Allan</PERSON> died on February 28, 1829, and <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, <PERSON>John Allan</PERSON> agreed to support <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the <ORGANIZATION>United States Military Academy</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Poe</PERSON> finally was discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him. Before entering <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> moved back to <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> for a time, to stay with his widowed aunt <PERSON>Maria Clemm</PERSON>, her daughter, <PERSON>Virginia Eliza Clemm</PERSON> (<PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s first cousin), his brother <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>, and his invalid grandmother <PERSON>Elizabeth Cairnes Poe</PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> published his second book, <PERSON>Al Aaraaf</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Tamerlane</LOCATION> and Minor Poems, in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> in 1829.

<PERSON>Poe</PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION> and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830. In October 1830, <PERSON>John Allan</PERSON> married his second wife, <PERSON>Louisa Patterson</PERSON>. The marriage, and bitter quarrels with <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> over the children born to <PERSON>Allan</PERSON> out of affairs, led to the foster father finally disowning <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> decided to leave <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION> by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> tactically pled not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing he would be found guilty.

He left for <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> in February 1831, and released a third volume of poems, simply titled Poems. The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION>, many of whom donated 75 cents to the cause, raising a total of $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> had been writing about commanding officers. Printed by <PERSON>Elam Bliss</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, it was labeled as "Second Edition" and included a page saying, "To the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Corps of Cadets</ORGANIZATION> this volume is respectfully dedicated." The book once again reprinted the long poems "<LOCATION>Tamerlane</LOCATION>" and "Al Aaraaf" but also six previously unpublished poems including early versions of "To Helen", "Israfel", and "<LOCATION>The City</LOCATION> in the Sea". He returned to <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, to his aunt, brother and cousin, in March 1831. His elder brother <PERSON>Henry</PERSON>, who had been in ill health in part due to problems with alcoholism, died on August 1, 1831.

After his brother's death, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> began more earnest attempts to start his career as a writer. He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. Publishers often pirated copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. Despite a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers or paid them much later than they promised. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>, throughout his attempts at pursuing a successful literary career, would be forced to constantly make humiliating pleas for money and other assistance for the rest of his life.

After his early attempts at poetry, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> had turned his attention to prose. He placed a few stories with a <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> publication and began work on his only drama, Politian. The Saturday Visitor, a <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> paper, awarded <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> a prize in October 1833 for his short story "MS. Found in a Bottle". The story brought him to the attention of <PERSON>John P. Kennedy</PERSON>, a Baltimorian of considerable means. He helped <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> place some of his stories, and introduced him to <PERSON>Thomas W. White</PERSON>, editor of the Southern Literary Messenger in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> became assistant editor of the periodical in August 1835; however, within a few weeks, he was discharged after being found drunk repeatedly. Returning to <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> secretly married <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>, his cousin, on September 22, 1835. She was 13 at the time, though she is listed on the marriage certificate as being 21. Reinstated by White after promising good behavior, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> went back to <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> with <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and her mother. He remained at the Messenger until January 1837. During this period, its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500. He published several poems, book reviews, criticism, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he had a second wedding ceremony in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Virginia Clemm</PERSON>, this time in public.

The Narrative of <PERSON>Arthur Gordon Pym</PERSON> was published and widely reviewed in 1838. In the summer of 1839, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> became assistant editor of <PERSON>Burton</PERSON>'s Gentleman's Magazine. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic that he had established at the Southern Literary Messenger. Also in 1839, the collection Tales of the Grotesque and <PERSON>Arabesque</PERSON> was published in two volumes, though he made little money off of it and it received mixed reviews. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> left <PERSON>Burton</PERSON>'s after about a year and found a position as assistant at <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>'s Magazine.

In June 1840, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal, The Stylus. Originally, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> intended to call the journal The <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION>, as it would have been based in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>. In the June 6, 1840 issue of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>'s Saturday Evening Post, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> bought advertising space for his prospectus: "Prospectus of the <ORGANIZATION>Penn Magazine</ORGANIZATION>, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Edgar A. Poe</PERSON>." The journal would never be produced before <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s death. Around this time, he attempted to secure a position with the <PERSON>Tyler</PERSON> administration, claiming he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Whig Party</ORGANIZATION>. He hoped to be appointed to the <ORGANIZATION>Custom House</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> with help from President <PERSON>Tyler</PERSON>'s son <PERSON>Robert</PERSON>, an acquaintance of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s friend <PERSON>Frederick Thomas</PERSON>. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> failed to show up for a meeting with <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to be sick, though <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> believed he was drunk. Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others.

One evening in January 1842, <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> showed the first signs of consumption, now known as tuberculosis, while singing and playing the piano. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> described it as breaking a blood vessel in her throat. She only partially recovered. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> began to drink more heavily under the stress of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION>'s illness. He left <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>'s and attempted to find a new position, for a time angling for a government post. He returned to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, where he worked briefly at the Evening Mirror before becoming editor of the Broadway Journal and, later, sole owner. There he alienated himself from other writers by publicly accusing <PERSON>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</PERSON> of plagiarism, though <PERSON>Longfellow</PERSON> never responded. On January 29, 1845, his poem "The Raven" appeared in the Evening Mirror and became a popular sensation. Though it made <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> a household name almost instantly, he only was paid $9 for its publication.

 <ORGANIZATION>Broadway Journal</ORGANIZATION> failed in 1846. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> moved to a cottage in the <LOCATION>Fordham</LOCATION> section of <LOCATION>The Bronx</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. That home, known today as the "Poe Cottage", is on the southeast corner of the Grand Concourse and <LOCATION>Kingsbridge Road</LOCATION>. Virginia died there on January 30, 1847. Biographers and critics often suggest <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s frequent theme of the "death of a beautiful woman" stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his wife.

Increasingly unstable after his wife's death, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> attempted to court the poet <PERSON>Sarah Helen Whitman</PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION>. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s drinking and erratic behavior. However, there is also strong evidence that <PERSON>Whitman</PERSON>'s mother intervened and did much to derail their relationship. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> then returned to <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> and resumed a relationship with a childhood sweetheart, <PERSON>Sarah Elmira Royster</PERSON>.

On October 3, 1849, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> was found on the streets of <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> delirious, "in great distress, and... in need of immediate assistance", according to the man who found him, <PERSON>Joseph W. Walker</PERSON>. He was taken to the <LOCATION>Washington College Hospital</LOCATION>, where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849, at 5:00 in the morning. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> was never coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition, and, oddly, was wearing clothes that were not his own. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> is said to have repeatedly called out the name "Reynolds" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. Some sources say <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s final words were "Lord help my poor soul." All medical records, including his death certificate, have been lost. Newspapers at the time reported <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s death as "congestion of the brain" or "cerebral inflammation", common euphemisms for deaths from disreputable causes such as alcoholism. However, the actual cause of death remains a mystery; from as early as 1872, cooping was commonly believed to have been the cause, and speculation has included delirium tremens, heart disease, epilepsy, syphilis, meningeal inflammation, cholera and rabies.

The day <PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe</PERSON> was buried, a long obituary appeared in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Tribune</ORGANIZATION> signed "Ludwig". It was soon published throughout the country. The piece began, "<PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe</PERSON> is dead. He died in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> the day before yesterday. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it." "Ludwig" was soon identified as <PERSON>Rufus Wilmot Griswold</PERSON>, an editor, critic and anthologist who had borne a grudge against <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> since 1842. <PERSON>Griswold</PERSON> somehow became <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s literary executor and attempted to destroy his enemy's reputation after his death.

<PERSON>Rufus Griswold</PERSON> wrote a biographical article of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> called "Memoir of the Author", which he included in an 1850 volume of the collected works. <PERSON>Griswold</PERSON> depicted <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> as a depraved, drunk, drug-addled madman and included <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s letters as evidence. Many of his claims were either outright lies or distorted half-truths. For example, it is now known that <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> was not a drug addict. <PERSON>Griswold</PERSON>'s book was denounced by those who knew <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> well, but it became a popularly accepted one. This occurred in part because it was the only full biography available and was widely reprinted and in part because readers thrilled at the thought of reading works by an "evil" man. Letters that <PERSON>Griswold</PERSON> presented as proof of this depiction of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> were later revealed as forgeries.



<PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s best known fiction works are Gothic, a genre he followed to appease the public taste. His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Many of his works are generally considered part of the dark romanticism genre, a literary reaction to transcendentalism, which <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> strongly disliked. He referred to followers of the movement as "Frogpondians" after the pond on <ORGANIZATION>Boston Common</ORGANIZATION>. and ridiculed their writings as "metaphor-run", lapsing into "obscurity for obscurity's sake" or "mysticism for mysticism's sake." <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> once wrote in a letter to <PERSON>Thomas Holley Chivers</PERSON> that he did not dislike Transcendentalists, "only the pretenders and sophists among them."

Beyond horror, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> also wrote satires, humor tales, and hoaxes. For comic effect, he used irony and ludicrous extravagance, often in an attempt to liberate the reader from cultural conformity. In fact, "Metzengerstein", the first story that <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> is known to have published, and his first foray into horror, was originally intended as a burlesque satirizing the popular genre. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> also reinvented science fiction, responding in his writing to emerging technologies such as hot air balloons in "The Balloon-Hoax".

<PERSON>Poe</PERSON> wrote much of his work using themes specifically catered for mass market tastes. To that end, his fiction often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and physiognomy.

<PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s writing reflects his literary theories, which he presented in his criticism and also in essays such as "The Poetic Principle". He disliked didacticism and allegory, though he believed that meaning in literature should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface. Works with obvious meanings, he wrote, cease to be art. He believed that quality work should be brief and focus on a specific single effect. To that end, he believed that the writer should carefully calculate every sentiment and idea. In "The Philosophy of Composition", an essay in which <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> describes his method in writing "The Raven", he claims to have strictly followed this method. It has been questioned, however, if he really followed this system. <PERSON>T. S. Eliot</PERSON> said: "It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method." Biographer <PERSON>Joseph Wood Krutch</PERSON> described the essay as "a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization".

During his lifetime, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> was mostly recognized as a literary critic. Fellow critic <PERSON>James Russell Lowell</PERSON> called him "the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>", though he questioned if he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> than in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> is particularly respected in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, in part due to early translations by <PERSON>Charles Baudelaire</PERSON>. <PERSON>Baudelaire</PERSON>'s translations became definitive renditions of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s work throughout <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s early detective fiction tales starring the fictitious <PERSON>C. Auguste Dupin</PERSON> laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir <PERSON>Arthur Conan Doyle</PERSON> said, "Each [of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> breathed the breath of life into it?" The Mystery Writers of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> have named their awards for excellence in the genre the "Edgars". <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s work also influenced science fiction, notably <PERSON>Jules Verne</PERSON>, who wrote a sequel to <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s novel The Narrative of <PERSON>Arthur Gordon Pym</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Nantucket</LOCATION> called The Narrative of <PERSON>Arthur Gordon Pym</PERSON>, Le sphinx des glaces. Science fiction author <PERSON>H. G. Wells</PERSON> noted, "<PERSON>Pym</PERSON> tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago."

Like many famous artists, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s works have spawned innumerable imitators. One interesting trend among imitators of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>, however, has been claims by clairvoyants or psychics to be "channeling" poems from <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s spirit. One of the most notable of these was <PERSON>Lizzie Doten</PERSON>, who in 1863 published Poems from the Inner Life, in which she claimed to have "received" new compositions by <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> poems such as "The Bells", but which reflected a new, positive outlook.

Even so, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> has not received only praise. <PERSON>William Butler Yeats</PERSON> was generally critical of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> and denounced him as "vulgar". Transcendentalist <PERSON>Ralph Waldo Emerson</PERSON> reacted to "The Raven" by saying, "I see nothing in it" and derisively referred to <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> as "the jingle man". <PERSON>Aldous Huxley</PERSON> wrote that <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s writing "falls into vulgarity" by being "too poetical" - the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger.

, an essay written in 1848, included a cosmological theory that presaged the big bang theory by 80 years, as well as the first plausible solution to Olbers' paradox. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> eschewed the scientific method in <LOCATION>Eureka</LOCATION> and instead wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece. Even so, <LOCATION>Eureka</LOCATION> is full of scientific errors. In particular, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s suggestions opposed Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.

<PERSON>Poe</PERSON> had a keen interest in the field of cryptography. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> paper <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>'s Weekly (Express) Messenger, inviting submissions of ciphers, which he proceeded to solve. In July 1841, <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> had published an essay called "A Few Words on Secret Writing" in <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>'s Magazine. Realizing the public interest in the topic, he wrote "The Gold-Bug" incorporating ciphers as part of the story. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s success in cryptography relied not so much on his knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple substitution cryptogram), as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage. The sensation <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> created with his cryptography stunt played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.

<PERSON>Poe</PERSON> had an influence on cryptography beyond increasing public interest in his lifetime. <PERSON>William Friedman</PERSON>, <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s foremost cryptologist, was heavily influenced by <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>. <PERSON>Friedman</PERSON>'s initial interest in cryptography came from reading "The Gold-Bug" as a child  interest he later put to use in deciphering <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s PURPLE code during World War II.

The historical <PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe</PERSON> has appeared as a fictionalized character, often representing the "mad genius" or "tormented artist" and exploiting his personal struggles. Many such depictions also blend in with characters from his stories, suggesting <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> and his characters share identities. Often, fictional depictions of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> use his mystery-solving skills in such novels as The Poe Shadow by <PERSON>Matthew Pearl</PERSON>.



No childhood home of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> is still standing, including the <PERSON>Allan</PERSON> family's <LOCATION>Moldavia</LOCATION> estate. The oldest standing home in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Old Stone House</ORGANIZATION>, is in use as the <PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe Museum</PERSON>, though <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> never lived there. The collection includes many items <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> used during his time with the <PERSON>Allan</PERSON> family and also features several rare first printings of <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> works. The dorm room <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> is believed to have used while studying at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> in 1826 is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is now overseen by a group of students and staff known as the <ORGANIZATION>Raven Society</ORGANIZATION>.

The earliest surviving home in which <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> lived is in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, preserved as the <PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe House</PERSON> and Museum. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> is believed to have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with <PERSON>Maria Clemm</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> (as well as his grandmother and possibly his brother <PERSON>William Henry Leonard Poe</PERSON>). It is open to the public and is also the home of the <PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe Society</PERSON>. Of the several homes that <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>, his wife <PERSON>Virginia</PERSON>, and his mother-in-law <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> rented in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, only the last house has survived. The Spring Garden home, where the author lived in 18431844, is today preserved by the <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> as the <PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe</PERSON> National Historic Site. <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s final home is preserved as the <PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe Cottage</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>Bronx</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>.

Other <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> landmarks include a building in the <LOCATION>Upper West Side</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> temporarily lived when he first moved to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. A plaque suggests that <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> wrote "The Raven" here. In <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, a plaque hangs near the building where <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> was born once stood. Believed to have been located at 62 Carver Street (now <PERSON>Charles Street</PERSON>), the plaque is possibly in an incorrect location. The bar in which legend says <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> was last seen drinking before his death still stands in Fells Point in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION>. Now known as The Horse You Came In On, local lore insists that a ghost they call "Edgar" haunts the rooms above.

Adding to the mystery surrounding <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s death, an unknown visitor affectionately referred to as the "Poe Toaster" has paid homage to <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s grave every year since 1949. As the tradition has been carried on for more than 50 years, it is likely that the "Poe Toaster" is actually several individuals; however, the tribute is always the same. Every January 19, in the early hours of the morning, the man makes a toast of cognac to <PERSON>Poe</PERSON>'s original grave marker and leaves three roses. Members of the <PERSON>Edgar Allan Poe Society</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> have helped in protecting this tradition for decades. On August 15, 2007, <PERSON>Sam Porpora</PERSON>, a former historian at the <LOCATION>Westminster Church</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> where <PERSON>Poe</PERSON> is buried, claimed that he had started the tradition in the 1960s. The claim that the tradition began in 1949, he said, was a hoax in order to raise money and enhance the profile of the church. His story has not been confirmed, and some details he has given to the press have been pointed out as factually inaccurate.

<TITLE><PERSON>Alfonso V</PERSON> of <PERSON>Aragon</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> the Magnanimous (also <PERSON>Alphonso</PERSON>; Catalan: <PERSON>Alfons</PERSON>) (1396 - 27 June 1458) was the King of <PERSON>Aragon</PERSON> (as <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> V), <LOCATION>Valencia</LOCATION> (as <PERSON>Alfonso III</PERSON>), <LOCATION>Majorca</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sardinia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION> (as <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> II), and <LOCATION>Sicily</LOCATION> and Count of <ORGANIZATION>Barcelona</ORGANIZATION> (as Alfonso IV) from 1416 and King of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> (as Alfonso I) from 1442 until his death. He was one of the most prominent figures of the early Renaissance and a knight of the Order of the Dragon. 

He was the son of Ferdinand I of <PERSON>Aragon</PERSON> (known as <PERSON>Ferdinand</PERSON> of <PERSON>Antequera</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Eleanor</PERSON> of <PERSON>Alburquerque</PERSON>. He represented the old line of the counts of <ORGANIZATION>Barcelona</ORGANIZATION> only through women, and was on his father's side descended from the <ORGANIZATION>House of Trastamara</ORGANIZATION>, a noble family of <LOCATION>Castile</LOCATION>. By hereditary right he was king of <LOCATION>Sicily</LOCATION> and disputed the island of <LOCATION>Sardinia</LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION>Genoa</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> was also in possession of much of <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION> by the 1420s.

In 1421 Queen <PERSON>Joan II</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>, who had no children, adopted and named him as heir to the Kingdom of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>, and <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> went to <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>. Here he hired the famous condottiero Braccio da Montone with the task of reducing the resistance of the other pretender, <PERSON>Louis III</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Anjou</LOCATION>, and his forces led by <PERSON>Muzio Attendolo Sforza</PERSON>. As Pope <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> V supported <PERSON>Sforza</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> switched religious allegiance to the Aragonese antipope <PERSON>Benedict XIII</PERSON>. When <PERSON>Sforza</PERSON> also abandoned <PERSON>Louis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> seemed to have all his problems solved; however, his relationship with <PERSON>Joanna</PERSON> suddenly worsened, and in May 1423 he had her lover, and a powerful figure in the Neapolitan court, <PERSON>Gianni Caracciolo</PERSON>, arrested. After an attempt to arrest the queen herself failed, <PERSON>Joanna</PERSON> called <PERSON>Sforza</PERSON> who defeated the Aragonese milices near <LOCATION>Castel Capuano</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> fled to <PERSON>Castel Nuovo</PERSON>, but the help of a fleet of 22 galleys led by <PERSON>Giovanni da Cardona</PERSON> improved his situation. <PERSON>Sforza</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joanna</PERSON> ransomed <PERSON>Caracciolo</PERSON> and retreated to the fortress of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON>. Here she repudiated her earlier adoption of <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> and, with support from <PERSON>Martin V</PERSON>, named <PERSON>Louis III</PERSON> as her heir instead. The Milanese Filippo <PERSON>Maria Visconti</PERSON> joined the anti-Aragonese coalition. <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> requested support from <PERSON>Braccio da Montone</PERSON>, who was besieging <PERSON>Joanna</PERSON>'s troops in <LOCATION>L'Aquila</LOCATION>, but had to set sail for <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>, where a war had broken out between his brothers and the Kingdom of <LOCATION>Castile</LOCATION>. On his way towards <ORGANIZATION>Barcelona</ORGANIZATION>, he destroyed <ORGANIZATION>Marseille</ORGANIZATION>, a possession of <PERSON>Louis III</PERSON>.



In the late 1423 the Genoese fleet of <PERSON>Visconti</PERSON> moved in the southern <LOCATION>Tyrrhenian Sea</LOCATION> and easily conquered <PERSON>Gaeta</PERSON>, <PERSON>Procida</PERSON>, Castellammare and <PERSON>Sorrento</PERSON>. <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>, which was held by <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON>Pedro</PERSON>, was besieged in 1424 by the Genoese ships and <PERSON>Joanna</PERSON>'s troops, now led by <PERSON>Francesco Sforza</PERSON>, son of <PERSON>Muzio</PERSON> (who had died at <LOCATION>L'Aquila</LOCATION>). The city fell in the April of that year. <PERSON>Pedro</PERSON>, after a short resistance in <LOCATION>Castel Nuovo</LOCATION>, fled to <LOCATION>Sicily</LOCATION> in August. <PERSON>Joanna II</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louis III</PERSON> again took possession of the realm, although the true power was in the hands of <PERSON>Gianni Caracciolo</PERSON>.

An opportunity for <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> to reconquer <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> occurred in 1432, when <PERSON>Caracciolo</PERSON> was killed in a conjure. <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> tried to regain the favour of the queen, but failed, and had to wait for the death of both <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> (at <LOCATION>Cosenza</LOCATION> in 1434) and <PERSON>Joanna</PERSON> herself (February 1435). In her will, she bequeathed her realm to <PERSON>Ren</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Anjou</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Louis III</PERSON>'s brother. This solution was opposed by the new pope, <PERSON>Eugene IV</PERSON>, who was nominal feudal lord of the King of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>. As the Neapolitans had called for the French, <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> decided to intervene and, with the support of several barons of the kingdom, captured <PERSON>Capua</PERSON> and besieged the important sea fortress of <PERSON>Gaeta</PERSON>. His fleet of 25 galleys was met by the Genoese ships sent by <PERSON>Visconti</PERSON>, led by <PERSON>Biagio Assereto</PERSON>. In the battle that ensued, <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> was defeated and taken prisoner.

In <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>, however, he impressed his captor with his cultured demeanor and persuaded him to let him go by making it plain that it was not in <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION>'s interest to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>. Helped by a Sicilian fleet, <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> recaptured <PERSON>Capua</PERSON> and set his base in <LOCATION>Gaeta</LOCATION> in the February of 1436. Papal troops had invaded the Neapolitan kingdom, but <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> corrupted the cardinal <PERSON>Giovanni Vitelleschi</PERSON>, who commanded them, and his successes waned. 



In the meantime, <PERSON>Ren</PERSON> had managed to reach <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> on may 19, 1438. <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> tried to besiege the city in the following September, but failed. His brother <PERSON>Pedro</PERSON> was killed during the battle. <PERSON>Castel Nuovo</PERSON>, where an Aragonese garrison resisted, fell to the <PERSON>Angevine</PERSON> mercenaries in the August of 1439. After the death of his condottiero <PERSON>Jacopo Caldora</PERSON>, however, <PERSON>Ren</PERSON>'s fortune started to wane: <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> could easily capture <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON>, <PERSON>Salerno</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Benevento</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Manfredonia</PERSON> and Bitonto. <PERSON>Ren</PERSON>, whose possession included now only part of the <LOCATION>Abruzzi</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>, obtained 10,000 men from the pope, but the cardinal leading them signed a truce with <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON>. <PERSON>Giovanni Sforza</PERSON> came with a reduced corps, as troops sent by <PERSON>Eugene IV</PERSON> had halted his father <PERSON>Francesco</PERSON> in the Marche. 

<PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON>, who was provided with the most impressive artillery of the time, again besieged <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>. The siege began on November 10, 1441, and ended on June 2 of the following year. After the return of <PERSON>Ren</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Provence</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> easily reduced the remaining resistance and made his triumphal entrance in <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> on February 26, 1443, as the monarch of a pacified kingdom. In 1446 he conquered also <LOCATION>Sardinia</LOCATION>, becoming the head of the most important kingdom of western <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>. 



<PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> had been betrothed to <PERSON>Mara de Castilla</PERSON> (1401-1458; sister of Juan II of <LOCATION>Castile</LOCATION>) in <LOCATION>Valladolid</LOCATION> in 1408; the marriage was celebrated in <LOCATION>Valencia</LOCATION> during 1415. They failed to produce children. <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> had been in love with a woman of noble family named <PERSON>Lucrezia d'Alagno</PERSON>, who served as a de facto queen at the Neapolitan court as well as an inspiring muse.

His Spanish possessions were ruled for him by his brother <PERSON>John</PERSON>. <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON>, by formally submitting his reign to the Papacy, obtained the consent of Pope <PERSON>Eugene IV</PERSON> that the Kingdom of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> would go to his immature son <PERSON>Ferdinand</PERSON>. He died in <LOCATION>Castel</LOCATION> dell'Ovo in 1458, while he was planning the conquest of <LOCATION>Genoa</LOCATION>. At the time, <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> was at odds with <PERSON>Callixtus III</PERSON>, who died shortly thereafter.

<LOCATION>Sicily</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sardinia</LOCATION> were inherited by his brother <PERSON>John</PERSON>, who survived him.

He was also a powerful and consistent supporter of Scanderbeg, whom he decided to take under his protection as a vassal in 1451, shortly after the latter had scored his second victory against <PERSON>Murad II</PERSON>. In addition to financial assistance, he supplied the Albanian leader with troops, military equipment, and sanctuary for himself and his family if such a need should arise. This was because in 1448, while <PERSON>Scanderbeg</PERSON> was victoriously fighting off the Turkish invasions, three military columns, commanded by <PERSON>Demetrio Reres</PERSON> along with his sons <PERSON>Giorgio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Basilio</PERSON>, were dispatched to help <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> V defeat the barons of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> who had rebelled against him.

Like a true prince of the Renaissance he favoured men of letters whom he trusted to preserve his reputation to posterity. He founded the Academy of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> and, for his entrance in the city in 1443, had a magnificent triumphal arch added to the main gate of <LOCATION>Castel Nuovo</LOCATION>. This edifice, considered the most important civil piece of art of the time, was designed by <PERSON>Francesco Laurana</PERSON>. His devotion to the classics was exceptional even for the time. For example, <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> halted his army in pious respect before the birthplace of a Latin writer, carried <PERSON>Livy</PERSON> or <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> on his campaigns with him, and his panegyrist Panormita even stated that the king was cured of an illness when a few pages of Quintus <PERSON>Curtius Rufus</PERSON>' history of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Great were read to him. However, the classics had not refined his taste, for he was amused by setting itinerant scholars, who swarmed to his court, to abuse one another in the indescribably filthy Latin scolding matches which were then the fashion. 

After his conquest of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> in 1442, <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> ruled by his mercenary soldiers and mercenary men of letters. In his Italian kingdom, he maintained the former political and administrative institutions; a unified General Chancellorship for the whole Aragonese reign was set in <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>, although the main functionaries were of Aragonese nationality. Apart from financial, administrative and artistical improvements, his other accomplishments in the Sicilian kingdom include the restoration of the aqueducts, the drainage of marshy areas, and the pavement of streets.

<PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> was the object of diplomatic contacts from the empire of <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION>. In 1428, he received a letter from Yeshaq I of <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION>, borne by two dignitaries, which proposed an alliance against the Muslims and would be sealed by a dual marriage that would require the <PERSON>Infante Don Pedro</PERSON> to bring a group of artisans to <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> where he would marry <PERSON>Yeshaq</PERSON>'s daughter. In return, <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> sent a party of 13 craftsmen, all of whom perished on the way to <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION>. He later sent a letter to <PERSON>Yeshaq</PERSON>'s successor <PERSON>Zara Yaqob</PERSON> in 1450, in which he wrote that he would be happy to send artisans to <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> if their safe arrival could be guaranteed, but it probably never reached the Emperor.

<PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>' accomplishments place him among the greatest baseball players of all-time. He has a record-setting seven Most Valuable Player awards, including a record-setting four consecutive MVPs. He is a fourteen time All-star, eight time gold glove-winner and he holds numerous Major League Baseball records. He currently holds the all-time Major League Baseball home run record with 762, and is also the all-time career leader in both walks (2,558) and intentional walks (688). He holds numerous other records, including the single-season <ORGANIZATION>Major League</ORGANIZATION> record for home runs (73), set in .

Since 2003, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> has been a key figure in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) scandal. He was under investigation by a federal grand jury regarding his testimony in the BALCO case, and was indicted on perjury and obstruction of justice charges on November 15, 2007. The indictment alleges that <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> lied while under oath about his alleged use of steroids.





Born in , <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> grew up in  and attended <ORGANIZATION>Junpero Serra High School</ORGANIZATION> in  and excelled in baseball, basketball and football. As a freshman, he spent the baseball season on the JV team. The next three years1980 to 1982he starred on the varsity team. He batted for a .467 batting average his senior year, and was honored as a prep All-American. The <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> drafted <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> in the second round of the 1982 <ORGANIZATION>MLB</ORGANIZATION> draft as a high school senior, but the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> were unable to agree on contract terms, so Bonds instead decided to attend college.

<PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State University</ORGANIZATION>, hitting .347 with 45 home runs and 175 runs batted in (RBI). In 1984 he batted .360 and had 30 stolen bases. In 1985 he hit 23 home runs with 66 RBIs and a .368 batting average. He was a Sporting News All-American selection that year. He tied the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> record with seven consecutive hits in the College World Series as sophomore and was named to All-Time College World Series Team in 1996. He graduated from <ORGANIZATION>Arizona State</ORGANIZATION> in 1986 with a degree in criminology. During college, he played part of one summer in the amateur <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Baseball League</ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Goldpanners</ORGANIZATION>.

<PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> was drafted by the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Pirates</ORGANIZATION> in the first round (6th overall) of the  Major League Baseball draft. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION>Prince William Pirates of the Carolina League</ORGANIZATION> and was named July 1985 Player of the Month for the league. In , he hit .311 in 44 games for the <ORGANIZATION>Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League</ORGANIZATION>, and he made his major league debut on May 30.

In 1986, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> led <ORGANIZATION>National League</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION>) rookies with 16 home runs, 48 RBI, 36 stolen bases and 65 walks, but he finished 6th in Rookie of the Year voting. He hit 25 home runs in his second season, along with 32 stolen bases and 59 RBIs. Bonds improved in 1988, hitting .283 with 24 home runs. Bonds finished with 19 homers, 58 RBIs, and 14 outfield assists, which was 2nd in <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION>. 

<PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> won his first MVP award in 1990, hitting .301 with 33 home runs and 114 RBIs. His 52 stolen bases were third in the league. He won his first Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards. In 1991, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> also put up great numbers, hitting 25 homers and driving in 116 runs, and obtained another Gold Glove and Silver Slugger. He finished second to the <ORGANIZATION>Atlanta Braves</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Terry Pendleton</PERSON> (the NL batting champion) in the MVP voting. The next season, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> won his second MVP award. He dominated the <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION>, hitting .311 with 34 homers and 103 RBIs, and propelling the <ORGANIZATION>Pirates</ORGANIZATION> to their third straight National League East division title. However, <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> was defeated by the <ORGANIZATION>Braves</ORGANIZATION> in a seven-game National League Championship Series. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> was involved in the final play of Game 7 of the NLCS, where he fielded a base hit by <PERSON>Francisco Cabrera</PERSON> and attempted to throw out <PERSON>Sid Bream</PERSON> at home plate. But the throw to <ORGANIZATION>Pirates</ORGANIZATION> catcher <PERSON>Mike LaValliere</PERSON> was late and <PERSON>Bream</PERSON> scored the winning run. For the third consecutive season, the <ORGANIZATION>NL East Champion Pirates</ORGANIZATION> were denied a trip to the World Series.

In 1993, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION>Pirates</ORGANIZATION> to sign a lucrative free agent contract worth a then-record $43.75 million over 6 years with the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>, with whom his father spent the first 7 years of his career, and with whom his godfather <PERSON>Willie Mays</PERSON> played 22 of his 24 <ORGANIZATION>Major League</ORGANIZATION> seasons. The deal was at that time the largest in baseball history, in terms of both total value and average annual salary. To honor his father, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> switched his jersey number to 25 once he signed with the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>, as it had been <PERSON>Bobby</PERSON>'s number in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION>. (His number during most of his stay with the <ORGANIZATION>Pirates</ORGANIZATION>, 24, was retired in honor of Mays anyway). Bonds hit .336 in 1993, leading the league with 46 home runs and 123 RBI en route to his second consecutive MVP award, and third overall. As good as the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> were (winning 103 games), the <ORGANIZATION>Atlanta Braves</ORGANIZATION> won 104 in what some call the last great pennant race (due to the Wild Card being instituted shortly after).

In the strike-shortened season of , Bonds hit .312 with 37 home runs and a league-leading 74 walks, and he finished 4th in MVP voting. In , <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> hit 33 homers and drove in 104 runs, hitting .294 but finished only 12th in MVP voting.

In , <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> became the first National League player and second (of the current list of four) major league player(s) to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season. The other members of the 40-40 club are <PERSON>Jos</PERSON> Canseco1988, <PERSON>Alex Rodriguez1998</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Alfonso</PERSON> Soriano2006; his father <PERSON>Bobby Bonds</PERSON> was one home run short in 1973 when he hit 39 home runs and stole 43 bases. Bonds drove in 129 runs with a .308 average and walked a then-National League record 151 times. During the 1996 season <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> became the 4th player in history to steal 300 bases and hit 300 home runs for a career, joining <PERSON>Willie Mays</PERSON>, <PERSON>Andre Dawson</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Bobby Bonds</PERSON> in the 300-300 club, but he only finished fifth in the MVP balloting. In  Bonds hit .291, his lowest average since 1989. He hit 40 home runs for the second straight year and drove in 101 runs, leading the league in walks again with 145. He tied his father in 1997 for having the most 30/30 seasons, and he again placed fifth in the MVP balloting.

In , he hit .303 with 37 home runs and drove in 122 runs, winning his eighth Gold Glove, and became the first player ever to enter the 400-400 club by having career totals of 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases. With two outs in the 9th inning of a game against the <ORGANIZATION>Arizona Diamondbacks</ORGANIZATION> on May 28, 1998, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> became only the fifth player in baseball history to be given an intentional walk with the bases loaded. Nap Lajoie (1901), <PERSON>Del Bissonette</PERSON> (1928) and <PERSON>Bill Nicholson</PERSON> (1944) were three others in the 20th century who received that rare honor; however <PERSON>Abner Dalrymple</PERSON> was the first to receive one in 1881. Bonds finished 8th in the MVP voting.

<PERSON>Bill James</PERSON> ranked <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> as the best player of the 1990s, adding that the decade's second-best player (<PERSON>Craig Biggio</PERSON>) had been closer in production to the decade's 10th-best player than to Bonds. In 1999, with statistics through 1997 being considered, Bonds ranked Number 34 on <ORGANIZATION>The Sporting News</ORGANIZATION>' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, making him the highest-ranking active player. When the <ORGANIZATION>Sporting News</ORGANIZATION> list was redone in 2005, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> was ranked 6th behind <PERSON>Babe Ruth</PERSON>, <PERSON>Willie Mays</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ty Cobb</PERSON>, <PERSON>Walter Johnson</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Henry Aaron</PERSON>. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> was omitted from 1999's <ORGANIZATION>Major League Baseball All-Century Team</ORGANIZATION>, to which <PERSON>Ken Griffey</PERSON>, Jr. was elected. <PERSON>James</PERSON> wrote of <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>, "Certainly the most unappreciated superstar of my lifetime... <PERSON>Griffey</PERSON> has always been more popular, but <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> has been a far, far greater player." In 1999, <PERSON>James</PERSON> rated <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> as the 16th best player of all time. "When people begin to take in all of his accomplishments", <PERSON>James</PERSON> predicted, "Bonds may well be rated among the five greatest players in the history of the game."



In 2000, the following year, Bonds hit .306 with a slugging percentage of .688 (career best at that time) and hit 49 home runs in just 143 games (also a career high to that point), while drawing a league-leading 117 walks.

The next year, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>' offensive production reached even higher levels, breaking not only his own personal records but several major league records. In the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' first 50 games in 2001, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> hit 28 home runs, including 17 in <LOCATION>Maya</LOCATION> career high. He also hit 39 home runs by the All-star break (a major league record), drew a major league record 177 walks, and had a .515 on-base average, a feat not seen since <PERSON>Mickey Mantle</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ted Williams</PERSON> over forty years earlier. Bonds' slugging percentage was a major league record .863 (411 total bases in 476 at-bats), and, most impressively, he ended the season with a major league record 73 home runs. 

Bonds re-signed with the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> for a five-year, $90 million contract in January 2002. That year, he hit 46 home runs in 403 at-bats. He won the <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION> batting title with a career-high .370 average and struck out only 47 times. Despite playing in nine fewer games than the previous season, he drew 198 walks, a major-league record, 68 of them intentional. He slugged .799, then the fourth-highest total all time. Bonds broke <PERSON>Ted Williams</PERSON>' major league record for on-base average with .582. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> also hit his 600th home run, less than a year and a half after hitting his 500th. 

In 2003, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> played in just 130 games. He hit 45 home runs in just 390 at-bats, along with a .341 batting average. He slugged .749, walked 148 times, and had an on-base average well over .500 (.529) for the third straight year. He also became the only member of the career 500 home run/500 stolen base club.

In 2004, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> had perhaps his best season. He hit .362 en route to his second National League batting title, and broke his own record by walking 232 times. He slugged .812, which was fourth-highest of all time, and broke his on-base percentage record with a .609 average. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> passed <PERSON>Mays</PERSON> on the career home run list, hitting his 700th near the end of the season. Bonds hit 45 home runs in 373 at-bats, and struck out just 41 times, putting himself in elite company, as few major leaguers have ever had more home runs than strikeouts in a season. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> would win his fourth consecutive MVP award and his seventh overall. His seven MVP awards are four more than any other player in history. In addition, no other player from either league has been awarded the MVP four times in a row. (The MVP award was first given in 1931). On July 4, 2004 he tied and passed <PERSON>Rickey Henderson</PERSON>'s career bases on balls record with his 2190th and 2191st career walks..

As <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> neared <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON>'s record, <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> was called on for his opinion of Bonds. He clarified that he was a fan and admirer of <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk due Bonds' to alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> expressed some reservations about the statements <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> made on the issue. <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with <PERSON>Pete Rose</PERSON> could be emphasized less. In 2007, <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> congratulated <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> through the media when <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> broke <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON>'s record.

Bonds' salary for the 2005 season was $22 million, the second-highest salary in Major League Baseball (the <ORGANIZATION>Yankees</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Alex Rodriguez</PERSON> earned the highest, $25.2 million).<PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> endured a knee injury, multiple surgeries, and rehabilitation. He was activated on September 12, 2005, and started in left field. In his return against the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Padres</ORGANIZATION>, he nearly hit a home run in his first at-bat. Bonds finished the night 1-for-4. Upon his return, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> resumed his high-caliber performance at the plate, hitting home runs in four consecutive games from September 18, 2005 to September 21, 2005 and finishing with five homers in only 14 games.

In 2006, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> earned $20 million (not including bonuses), the fourth highest salary in baseball. Through the 2006 season he had earned approximately $172 million during his then 21-year career, making him baseball's all-time highest paid player.Bonds hit under .200 for his first 10 games of the season and did not hit a home run until April 22, 2006. This 10-game stretch was his longest home run slump since the 1998 season. On May 7, 2006, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> drew within one home run of tying Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> for second place on the all time list, hitting his 713th career home run into the second level of <ORGANIZATION>Citizens Bank Park</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, off pitcher <PERSON>Jon Lieber</PERSON> in an <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION> nationally-televised game in which the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> lost to the <ORGANIZATION>Philadelphia Phillies</ORGANIZATION>. The towering home runone of the longest in <ORGANIZATION>Citizens Bank Park</ORGANIZATION>'s two-season history, traveling an estimated 450 feet (140 m)hit off the facade of the third deck in right field.

Then, on May 20, 2006, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> tied <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, hitting his 714th career home run to deep right field to lead off the top of the 2nd inning. The home run came off left-handed pitcher <PERSON>Brad Halsey</PERSON> of the Oakland A's, in an interleague game played in <LOCATION>Oakland</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. Since this was an interleague game at an American League stadium, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> was batting as the designated hitter in the lineup for the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> was quoted after the game as being "glad it's over with" and stated that more attention could be focused on <PERSON>Albert Pujols</PERSON>, who was on a very rapid home run pace in early 2006.

 On May 28, 2006, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> passed <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>, hitting his 715th career home run to center field off <ORGANIZATION>Colorado Rockies</ORGANIZATION> pitcher <PERSON>Byung-Hyun Kim</PERSON>. The ball was hit an estimated 445 feet (140 m) into center field where it went through the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where <PERSON>Andrew Morbitzer</PERSON>, a 38-year-old <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> resident, caught the ball while he was in line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster <PERSON>Dave Flemming</PERSON>'s radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> broadcaster <PERSON>Duane Kuiper</PERSON>, was not affected.

On September 22, 2006, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> tied <PERSON>Henry Aaron</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>National League</ORGANIZATION> career home run record of 733. The home run came in the top of the 6th inning of a high-scoring game against the <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee Brewers</ORGANIZATION>, at <LOCATION>Miller Park</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION>. The achievement was notable for its occurrence in the very city where <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> began (with the <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee Braves</ORGANIZATION>) and concluded (with the <ORGANIZATION>Brewers</ORGANIZATION>, then in the American League) his career. With the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> trailing 10-8, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> hit a blast to deep center field on a 2-0 pitch off the <ORGANIZATION>Brewers</ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON>Chris Spurling</PERSON> with runners on first and second and one out. Though the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> were at the time clinging to only a slim chance of making the playoffs, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>' home run provided the additional drama of giving the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> an 11-10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race. The <ORGANIZATION>Brewers</ORGANIZATION> eventually won the game, 13-12, despite <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>' going 3 for 5, with 2 doubles, the record-tying home run, and 6 runs batted in.

On the following day, September 23, 2006, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> surpassed <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION>NL</ORGANIZATION> career home run record. Hit in <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> like the previous one, this was a solo home run off <PERSON>Chris Capuano</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Brewers</ORGANIZATION>. This was the last home run Bonds hit in 2006. In 2006, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> recorded his lowest slugging percentage (a statistic that he has historically ranked among league leaders season after season) since 1991 with the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Pirates</ORGANIZATION>.

In January 2007, the <ORGANIZATION>New York Daily News</ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> had tested positive for amphetamines. Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling. The policy also stated that players were not to be identified for a first positive test, but the <ORGANIZATION>New York Daily News</ORGANIZATION> leaked the test's results. When the <ORGANIZATION>Players Association</ORGANIZATION> informed <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> teammate <PERSON>Mark Sweeney</PERSON>, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to <PERSON>Sweeney</PERSON>.

On January 29, 2007, the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> finalized a contract with Bonds for the 2007 season. After the commissioner's office rejected <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>'s one-year, $15.8 million deal because it contained a personal-appearance provision, the team sent revised documents to his agent, <PERSON>Jeff Borris</PERSON>, who stated that "At this time, <PERSON>Barry</PERSON> is not signing the new documents."Bonds signed a revised one-year, $15.8 million contract on February 15, 2007, and reported to the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' Spring Training camp on time.

<PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> resumed his march to the all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately followed by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> returned the next day, April 4, 2007, with another mission. In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION>AT&T</ORGANIZATION> Park, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> hit a <PERSON>Chris Young</PERSON> (of the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Padres</ORGANIZATION>) pitch just over the wall to the left of straightaway center field for career home run 735. This home run put <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> past the midway point between <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> and <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON>.

<PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> did not homer again until April 13, 2007 when he hit two (736 and 737) in a 3 for 3 night that included 4 RBI against the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Pirates</ORGANIZATION>. Home runs number 739 and 740 came in back to back games on April 21, 2007 and April 22, 2007 against the <ORGANIZATION>Arizona Diamondbacks</ORGANIZATION>. 

The hype surrounding Bonds' pursuit of the home run record escalated on May 14, 2007. On this day, Sports Auction for <ORGANIZATION>Heritage</ORGANIZATION> (a Dallas-based auction house) offered US$1 million to the fan that caught <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>' record-breaking 756th-career home run. The million dollar offer was rescinded on June 11, 2007 out of concern of fan safety. On that same day, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> launched home run 747, ending the relative drought of the previous month. This one came off <PERSON>Josh Towers</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Toronto Blue Jays</ORGANIZATION>, and landed in <ORGANIZATION>AT&T Park</ORGANIZATION>'s right center field stands. His next home run, 748, came on Father's Day, June 17, 2007, in the final game of a 3-game road series against the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Red Sox</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Fenway Park</LOCATION>, where <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> had never previously played. With this homer, <PERSON>Fenway Park</PERSON> became the 36th major league ballpark in which <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> had hit a home run. He hit a <PERSON>Tim Wakefield</PERSON> knuckleball just over the low fence into the Giant's bullpen in right field. It was his first home run off his former <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Pirate</ORGANIZATION> teammate, who became the 441st different pitcher to surrender a four-bagger to Bonds. The 750th career home run, hit on June 29, 2007, also came off a former teammate: <PERSON>Livn Hernndez</PERSON>. The blast came in the 8th inning and at that point tied the game at 3-3.

On July 19, 2007, after a 21 at-bat hitless streak, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> hit 2 home runs, numbers 752 and 753 against the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Cubs</ORGANIZATION>. He went 33 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs, and a walk on that day. The struggling last place <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> still lost the game 9-8. On July 27, 2007, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> hit home run 754 against <ORGANIZATION>Florida Marlins</ORGANIZATION> pitcher <PERSON>Rick VandenHurk</PERSON>. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> was then walked his next 4 at bats in the game, but 2-run shot helped the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> win the game 12-10. It marked the first game Bonds had homered in that the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> won since he had hit #747. On August 4, 2007, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> hit a 382 foot (116 m) home run against <PERSON>Clay Hensley</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>San Diego Padres</ORGANIZATION> for home run number 755, tying <PERSON>Hank Aaron</PERSON>'s all-time record. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> greeted his son, <PERSON>Nikolai</PERSON>, with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> greeted his teammates and then his wife, <PERSON>Liz Watson</PERSON>, and daughter <PERSON>Aisha Lynn</PERSON> behind the backstop. <PERSON>Hensley</PERSON> was the 445th different pitcher to give up a home run to Bonds. Ironically, given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who'd been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use. He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.

On August 7, 2007 at 8:51 PM PDT, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> hit a 435 foot (133 m) home run, his 756th, off a pitch from <PERSON>Mike Bacsik</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Nationals, breaking the all-time career home run record, formerly held by <PERSON>Hank Aaron</PERSON>. Coincidentally, <PERSON>Bacsik</PERSON>'s father had faced <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> (as a pitcher for the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Rangers</ORGANIZATION>) after <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> had hit his 755th home run. On August 23, 1976, <PERSON>Michael J. Bacsik</PERSON> held <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> to a single and a fly out to right field. The younger <PERSON>Bacsik</PERSON> commented later, "If my dad had been gracious enough to let <PERSON>Hank Aaron</PERSON> hit a home run, we both would have given up 756." After hitting the home run, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> gave <PERSON>Bacsik</PERSON> an autographed bat.

The pitch, the seventh of the at-bat, was a 32 pitch which Bonds hit into the right-center field bleachers. The fan who ended up with the ball, 22-year-old <PERSON>Matt Murphy</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Queens</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> (and a Met fan), was promptly protected and escorted away from the mayhem by a group of <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> police officers. After <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> finished his home run trot, a ten-minute delay followed, including a brief video by <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> congratulating <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> on breaking the record <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> had held for 33 years, and expressing the hope that "the achievement of this record will inspire others to chase their own dreams." <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> made an impromptu emotional statement on the field, with <PERSON>Willie Mays</PERSON>, his godfather, at his side and thanked his teammates, family and his late father. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> sat out the rest of the game and was replaced in left field.

The commissioner, <PERSON>Bud Selig</PERSON>, was not in attendance in this game but was represented by the Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations, <PERSON>Jimmie Lee Solomon</PERSON>. <PERSON>Selig</PERSON> called <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> later that night to congratulate him on breaking the record. President <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> also called Bonds the next day to congratulate him. On August 24, 2007, <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> honored and celebrated Bonds' career accomplishments and breaking the home run record with a large rally in <PERSON>Justin Herman Plaza</PERSON>. The rally included video messages from <PERSON>Lou Brock</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ernie Banks</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ozzie Smith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joe Montana</PERSON>, <PERSON>Wayne Gretzky</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael Jordan</PERSON>. Speeches were made by <PERSON>Willie Mays</PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> teammates <PERSON>Omar Vizquel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rich Aurilia</PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON>Peter Magowan</PERSON>. Mayor <PERSON>Gavin Newsom</PERSON> presented Bonds the key to the City and <ORGANIZATION>County of San Francisco and Giants</ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON>Larry Baer</PERSON> gave <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> the home plate he touched after hitting his 756th career home run.

The record-setting ball was consigned to an auction house on August 21, 2007, and sold with a winning bid of USD$752,467 on September 15, 2007. The high bidder, fashion designer <PERSON>Marc Ecko</PERSON>, created a website to let fans decide its fate.Ben <PERSON>Padnos</PERSON>, who submitted the (<LOCATION>US</LOCATION>) $186,750 winning bid on Bonds' record-tying 755th home run ball also set up a website to let fans decide its fate. Of <PERSON>Ecko</PERSON>'s plans, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> said "He spent $750,000 on the ball and that's what he's doing with it? What he's doing is stupid."

Bonds concluded the 2007 season with a .276 batting average, 28 home runs, and 66 RBIs in 126 games and 340 at bats. At the age of 43, he led both leagues in walks with 132.

On September 21, 2007, the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Giants</ORGANIZATION> confirmed that they would not re-sign <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> for the 2008 season. The story was first announced on Bonds' own web site earlier that day. He filed for free agency on October 29, 2007.

There was much speculation about where <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> might play in 2008 and possibly beyond. During the offseason, experts suggested nearly a dozen teams as possible destinations. Most talk was of Bonds signing for only the 2008 season as he needs just 65 hits to reach 3,000 and 38 home runs to reach 800. In addition to the hits, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> needs 69 more runs scored to move past <PERSON>Rickey Henderson</PERSON> as the all-time runs champion. He needs 38 extra base hits to move past <PERSON>Hank Aaron</PERSON> as the all-time extra base hits champion. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> also continues to talk of his quest for a World Series championship as motivation for returning.

Since filing for free agency, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> has said he is ready to play and would like to be signed. During the 2008 season, teams said to have been contemplating signing Bonds include the <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Tigers</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Red Sox</ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION>New York Yankees</ORGANIZATION>. However, as of early September 2008 he had not yet been signed.

In 2003, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> became embroiled in a scandal when <PERSON>Greg Anderson</PERSON> of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (henceforth BALCO), <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>' trainer since 2000, was indicted by a federal grand jury in the <LOCATION>United States District Court</LOCATION> for the Northern District of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and charged with supplying anabolic steroids to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet and legitimate supplements. 

During grand jury testimony on December 4, 2003which was later found to be obtained through an illegal leak by <PERSON>Troy Ellerman</PERSON>, a defense lawyer for <PERSON>Victor Conte</PERSON>, to the <ORGANIZATION>San Francisco Chronicle</ORGANIZATION> (leaking grand jury testimony is a felony, to which <PERSON>Ellerman</PERSON> pled guilty to on February 14, 2007) and published almost a year later, on December 3, 2004Bonds said that he used a clear substance and a cream that he received from his personal strength trainer, <PERSON>Greg Anderson</PERSON>, who told him they were the nutritional supplement flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis. This testimony, as reported by <PERSON>Lance Williams</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark Fainaru-Wada</PERSON>, has frequently been misrepresented. Later reports on Bonds's leaked grand-jury testimony contend that he admitted to unknowingly using "the cream" and "the clear".

In July 2005, all four defendants in the BALCO steroid scandal trial, including <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON>, struck deals with federal prosecutors that did not require them to reveal names of athletes who may have used banned drugs.

Bonds withdrew from the <ORGANIZATION>MLB Players Association</ORGANIZATION>'s (<ORGANIZATION>MLBPA</ORGANIZATION>) licensing agreement because he felt independent marketing deals would be more lucrative for him. Bonds is the first player in the thirty-year history of the licensing program not to sign. Because of this withdrawal, his name and likeness are not usable in any merchandise licensed by the <ORGANIZATION>MLBPA</ORGANIZATION>. In order to use his name or likeness, a company must deal directly with <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>. For this reason he does not appear in some baseball video games, forcing game-makers to create generic athletes to replace him. For example, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> is replaced by "<PERSON>Jon Dowd</PERSON>" in MVP Baseball 2005, 

In March, 2006 the book Game of Shadows, written by <PERSON>Lance Williams</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mark Fainaru-Wada</PERSON>, was released amid a storm of media publicity including the cover of Sports Illustrated. Initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of Sports Illustrated. The book alleges <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> used stanozolol and a host of other steroids, and is perhaps most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds' steroid use.

The book contained excerpts of grand jury testimony that is supposed to be sealed and confidential by law. The authors have been steadfast in their refusal to divulge their sources, and at one point faced jail time. On February 14, 2007, <PERSON>Troy Ellerman</PERSON>, one of <PERSON>Victor Conte</PERSON>'s lawyers, pled guilty to leaking grand jury testimony. Through the plea agreement, he will spend two and a half years in jail.

In May 2006, former Sports Illustrated writer <PERSON>Jeff Pearlman</PERSON> released a scathing biography of Bonds entitled Love Me, Hate Me: <PERSON>Barry Bonds</PERSON> and the Making of an Anti-Hero. The book also contained many allegations against Bonds. The book, which describes <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> as a polarizing insufferable braggart with a legendary ego and staggering ability, relied on over five hundred interviews.

On November 15, 2007, <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> was indicted for both four counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice as it relates to the government investigation of BALCO.

On February 14, 2008 a typo in court papers filed by Federal prosecutors erroneously alleged that <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> tested positive for steroids in November, 2001, a month after hitting his record 73rd home run. The reference was meant instead to refer to a November 2000 test that had already been disclosed and previously reported. The typo sparked a brief media frenzy.

His trial for obstruction of justice is to begin on March 2, 2009. Mr <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> is not expected to get prison time should he be convicted after a pro cyclist facing similar charges in the case was given house arrest and probation instead of jail time. 

In April 2006 and May 2006, <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION> aired a few episodes of a 10-part reality TV (unscripted, documentary-style) series starring <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>. The show, titled Bonds on Bonds, focused on Bonds' chase of Babe <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON>'s and <PERSON>Hank Aaron</PERSON>'s home run records. Some felt the show should be put on hiatus until baseball investigated <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON>' steroid use allegations. The series was canceled in June 2006, <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION> and producer Tollin/Robbins Productions citing "creative control" issues with <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> and his representatives.

<PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> met <PERSON>Susann</PERSON> ("Sun") <PERSON>Margreth Branco</PERSON>, the mother of his first two children, in  in August 1987. They eloped in  February 5, 1988. They had two children (<PERSON>Nikolai</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Shikari</LOCATION>) and separated in June 1994, divorced in December 1994 and had their marriage annulled in 1997 by the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>. The divorce was a media affair because <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> had his Swedish spouse sign a prenuptial agreement in which she "waived her right to a share of his present and future earnings" and which was upheld. <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> had been providing his wife $20,000/month in child support and $10,000 in spousal support at the time of the ruling. During the hearings to set permanent support levels, allegations of abuse came from both parties. The trial dragged on for months, but <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> was awarded both houses and reduced support. <PERSON>Nikolai</PERSON> was a batboy for the <ORGANIZATION>Giants</ORGANIZATION> and always sat next to his dad in the dugout during games.

Bonds remarried on January 10, 1998 in the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> Ritz-Carlton Hotel in front of 240 guests. Bonds lives in <LOCATION>Los Altos Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, with his second wife, <PERSON>Liz Watson</PERSON>, and their daughter <PERSON>Aisha</PERSON>. He also owns a home in the exclusive gated community of <LOCATION>Beverly Park</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>CA</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> also had an extensive intimate relationship with <PERSON>Kimberly Bell</PERSON> from 1994 through May, 2003. Bonds purchased a home in  for <PERSON>Kimberly</PERSON>.

<PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> has an older brother, <PERSON>Bobby, Jr.</PERSON> who was a professional baseball player. His paternal aunt, <PERSON>Rosie Bonds</PERSON>, is a former American record holder in the 80 meter hurdles, and she competed in the 1964 Olympics. He is a distant cousin of Hall of <PERSON>Famer Reggie Jackson</PERSON>.

Besides holding <ORGANIZATION>Major League</ORGANIZATION> career records in home runs (762), walks (2,558), and intentional walks (688), <PERSON>Bonds</PERSON> also leads all active players in RBI (1,996), on-base percentage (.444), runs (2,227), games (2,986), extra-base hits (1,440), at-bats per home run (12.92), and total bases (5,976). He is 2nd in doubles (601), slugging percentage (.607), stolen bases (514), at-bats (9,847), and hits (2,935), 6th in triples (77), 8th in sacrifice flies (91), and 9th in strikeouts (1,539), through September 26, 2007.

Bonds is the lone member of the 500500 club, which means he has hit at least 500 home runs (762) and stolen 500 bases (514). He is also one of only four baseball players all-time to be in the 4040 club (1996), which means he hit 40 home runs (42) and stole 40 bases (40) in the same season.

















<TITLE><PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION></TITLE>

<PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> (<PERSON>Aleksandr</PERSON>) II Nikolaevich () (<LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, 29 April 1818 13 March 1881 in <LOCATION>St. Petersburg</LOCATION>) was the Emperor of the Russian Empire from 3 March 1855 until his assassination in 1881. He was also the Grand Duke of <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> and King of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> until 1867 when it was annexed into the Russian Empire.

Born in 1818, he was the eldest son of <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> I and <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> of <LOCATION>Prussia</LOCATION>, daughter of <PERSON>Frederick William III</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Prussia</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz</PERSON>. His early life gave little indication of his ultimate potential; until the time of his accession in 1855, few imagined that he would be known to posterity as a leader able to implement the most challenging reforms undertaken in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> since the reign of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> the Great. 

In the period of over thirty-six years during which he was heir apparent, the atmosphere of <LOCATION>St Petersburg</LOCATION> was unfavourable to the development of any intellectual or political innovation. Government was based on principles under which all freedom of thought and all private initiative were, as far as possible, suppressed vigorously. Personal and official censorship was rife; criticism of the authorities was regarded as a serious offence. This was also regarded as one of the reasons which led to his assassination.

Under supervision of the liberal poet <PERSON>Vasily Zhukovsky</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> received the education commonly given to young Russians of good family at that time: a smattering of a great many subjects, and exposure to the chief modern European languages. He took little personal interest in military affairs to the disappointment of his father, who was passionate about the military. <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> gave evidence of a kind disposition and a warmheartedness which were considered out of place in one destined to become a military autocrat.

<PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON> succeeded to the throne upon the death of his father in 1855. The first year of his reign was devoted to the prosecution of the Crimean War, and after the fall of <LOCATION>Sevastopol</LOCATION> to negotiations for peace, led by his trusted counselor, <PERSON>Prince Gorchakov</PERSON>. Then he began a period of radical reforms, encouraged by public opinion but carried out with autocratic power. All who had any pretensions to enlightenment declared loudly that the country had been exhausted and humiliated by the war, and that the only way of restoring it to its proper position in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> was to develop its natural resources and thoroughly to reform all branches of the administration. The government therefore found in the educated classes a new-born public spirit, anxious to assist it in any work of reform that it might think fit to undertake. 

Fortunately for <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> the autocratic power was now in the hands of a man who was impressionable enough to be deeply influenced by the spirit of the time, and who had sufficient prudence and practicality to prevent his being carried away by the prevailing excitement into the dangerous region of Utopian dreaming. Unlike some of his predecessors, he had no grand, original schemes of his own to impose by force on unwilling subjects, and no pet projects to lead his judgment astray. He looked instinctively with a suspicious, critical eye upon the panaceas which more imaginative and less cautious people recommended. These character traits, together with the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed, determined the part he would play in bringing to fruition the reform aspirations of the educated classes.

However, the growth of a revolutionary movement to the "left" of the educated classes led to an abrupt end to <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>'s changes when he was assassinated by a bomb in 1881. It is interesting to note that after <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> became tsar in 1855, he maintained a generally liberal course at the helm while providing a target for numerous assassination attempts (1866, 1873, 1880).

Though he carefully guarded his autocratic rights and privileges, and obstinately resisted all efforts to push him farther than he felt inclined to go, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> for several years acted somewhat like a constitutional sovereign of the continental type. Soon after the conclusion of peace, important changes were made in legislation concerning industry and commerce, and the new freedom thus afforded produced a large number of limited liability companies. Plans were formed for building a great network of railways -- partly for the purpose of developing the natural resources of the country, and partly for the purpose of increasing its power for defense and attack.

Then it was found that further progress was blocked by a formidable obstacle: the existence of serfdom. <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> showed that, unlike his father, he meant to grapple boldly with this difficult and dangerous problem. Taking advantage of a petition presented by the Polish landed proprietors of the Lithuanian provinces, and hoping that their relations with the serfs might be regulated in a more satisfactory way (meaning in a way more satisfactory for the proprietors), he authorized the formation of committees "for ameliorating the condition of the peasants," and laid down the principles on which the amelioration was to be effected.

This step was followed by one still more significant. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of European <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the governor-general of <LOCATION>Lithuania</LOCATION>, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting that perhaps the landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed.

The deliberations at once raised a host of important, thorny questions. The emancipation was not merely a humanitarian question capable of being solved instantaneously by imperial ukase. It contained very complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation.

<PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> had little of the special knowledge required for dealing successfully with such problems, and he had to restrict himself to choosing between the different measures recommended to him. The main point at issue was whether the serfs should become agricultural labourers dependent economically and administratively on the landlords, or whether they should be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors. The emperor gave his support to the latter project, and the Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> to shake off serfdom.

The architects of the emancipation manifesto were <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>'s brother <PERSON>Konstantin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Yakov Rostovtsev</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Nikolay Milyutin</PERSON>. On 3 March 1861, the sixth anniversary of his accession, the emancipation law was signed and published.

Other reforms followed: army and navy re-organization (1874); a new judicial administration based on the French model (1864); a new penal code and a greatly simplified system of civil and criminal procedure; an elaborate scheme of local self-government (Zemstvo) for the rural districts (1864) and the large towns (1870), with elective assemblies possessing a restricted right of taxation, and a new rural and municipal police under the direction of the Minister of the Interior. <PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON> would be the second monarch (after King Louis I of <LOCATION>Portugal</LOCATION>) to abolish capital punishment, a penalty which is still legal (although not practised) in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>.

However, the workers wanted better working conditions; national minorities wanted freedom. When radicals began to resort to the formation of secret societies and to revolutionary agitation, <PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON> felt constrained to adopt severe repressive measures.

<PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON> resolved to try the effect of some moderate liberal reforms in an attempt to quell the revolutionary agitation, and for this purpose he instituted a ukase for creating special commissions, composed of high officials and private personages who should prepare reforms in various branches of the administration.



During his bachelor days, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> made a state visit to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> in 1838. Just a year older than the young <PERSON>Queen Victoria</PERSON>, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> took a liking to his distant cousin. The fondness however, was short-lived. While <PERSON>Victoria</PERSON> married her German cousin, Prince <PERSON>Albert</PERSON> in February 1840, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> became a husband the next year. On 16 April 1841 he married Princess <PERSON>Marie of Hesse</PERSON> in <LOCATION>St Petersburg</LOCATION>, thereafter known as <PERSON>Maria Alexandrovna</PERSON>. The Tsarevitch claimed to be deeply in love with the young Princess and vowed to marry no one else. <PERSON>Marie</PERSON> was the legal daughter of <PERSON>Ludwig II</PERSON>, Grand Duke of <PERSON>Hesse</PERSON> and by <LOCATION>Rhine</LOCATION> and Princess <PERSON>Wilhelmina</PERSON> of <PERSON>Baden</PERSON>, although there was a question of whether the Grand Duke or her mother's lover, <PERSON>Baron August von Senarclens de Grancy</PERSON>, was her biological father. <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> was aware of the question of her paternity. The marriage produced six sons and two daughters:

<PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> had many mistresses during his marriage and fathered 7 known illegitimate children. These included <PERSON>Antoinette Bayer</PERSON> (20 June 1856-24 January 1948) with his mistress <PERSON>Wilhelmine Bayer</PERSON>; <PERSON>Michael-Bogdan Oginski</PERSON> (10 October 1848-25 March 1909) with mistress Countess <PERSON>Olga Kalinovskya</PERSON> (1818-1854); and <PERSON>Joseph Raboxicz</PERSON>.

On 6 July 1880, less than a month after <PERSON>Tsarina Maria</PERSON>'s death on 8 June, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> formed a morganatic marriage with his mistress Princess <PERSON>Catherine Dolgorukov</PERSON>, with whom he already had four children. 

At the beginning of his reign, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> expressed the famous statement "No dreams" addressed for Poles, populating <ORGANIZATION>Congress Poland</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Western Ukraine</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lithuania</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Livonia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Belarus</LOCATION>. The result was the January Uprising of 1863-1864 that was suppressed after eighteen months of fighting. Thousands of Poles were executed, tens of thousands were deported to <LOCATION>Siberia</LOCATION>. The price for suppression was Russian support for Prussian-united <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>. Twenty years later, <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> became the major enemy of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> on the continent.

All territories of the former Poland-Lithuania were excluded from liberal policies introduced by <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>. The martial law in <LOCATION>Lithuania</LOCATION>, introduced in 1863, lasted for the next 50 years. Native languages, Lithuanian, Ukrainian and Belarusian were completely banned from printed texts, see a , e.g., Ems Ukase. The Polish language was banned in both oral and written form from all provinces except <LOCATION>Congress Kingdom</LOCATION>, where it was allowed in private conversations only.



In 1863 <PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON> re-established the Diet of <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> and initiated several reforms increasing <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>'s autonomy from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> including establishment of own currency, the Markka. Liberation of enterprise led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. <PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON> is still regarded as "The Good Tsar" in <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>'s attitude towards <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> could be seen as genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in a small, homogeneous country than the whole of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>. The benevolent treatment of <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western oriented population during the Crimean war and during the Polish uprising. Encouraging Finnish nationalism and language can also be seen as an attempt to weaken the strong ties with <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>.

In 1866 there was an attempt on his life in <LOCATION>Petersburg</LOCATION> by <PERSON>Dmitry Karakozov</PERSON>. To commemorate his narrow escape from death (which he referred to only as "the event of April 4, 1866"), a number of churches and chapels were built in many Russian cities.

On the morning of 20 April 1879, <PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON> was briskly walking towards the Square of the Guards Staff and faced <PERSON>Alexander Soloviev</PERSON>, a 33 year-old former student. Having seen a menacing revolver in his hands, the Tsar fled. <PERSON>Soloviev</PERSON> fired five times but missed;and he was sentenced to death and hanged on 28 May.

The student acted on his own, but other revolutionaries were keen to murder <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>. In December 1879, the <ORGANIZATION>Narodnaya Volya</ORGANIZATION> (People's Will), a radical revolutionary group which hoped to ignite a social revolution, organised an explosion on the railway from <LOCATION>Livadia</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>, but they missed the Tsar's train. On the evening of 5 February 1880 the same revolutionaries set off a charge under the dining room of the Winter Palace, right in the resting room of the guards a story below. Being late for supper, the Tsar was unharmed, although 67 other people were killed or wounded. The dining room floor was also heavily damaged.

After the last assassination attempt, <PERSON>Count Loris-Melikov</PERSON> was appointed the head of the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Executive Commission</ORGANIZATION> and given extraordinary powers to fight the revolutionaries. <PERSON>Loris-Melikov</PERSON>'s proposals called for some form of parliamentary body, and the Emperor seemed to agree; these plans were never realized as on 13 March (1 March Old Style Date), 1881 <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> fell victim to an assassination plot.

As he had done every Sunday for a score of years, the tsar went to the Manege to review the <ORGANIZATION>Life Guards of the Reserve Infantry</ORGANIZATION> and the Life Guards of the Sapper Battalion regiments. He travelled both to and from the Menege in a closed carriage accompanied by six Cossacks with a seventh sitting on the coachman's left. The tsar's carriage was followed by two sleighs carrying, among others, the chief of police and the chief of the tsar's guards. The route, as always, was via the <ORGANIZATION>Catherine Canal</ORGANIZATION> and over the <LOCATION>Pevchesky Bridge</LOCATION>.

The street was flanked by narrow sidewalks on both the right and left side. A short young man wearing a heavy black overcoat edged towards the imperial carriage making its way down the street. He was carrying a small white package wrapped in a handkerchief. The youth was <PERSON>Nikolai Rysakov</PERSON>,"After a moment's hesitation I threw the bomb. I sent it under the horses' hooves in the supposition that it would blow up under the carriage...The explosion knocked me into the fence."

The explosion, while killing one of the Cossacks and seriously wounding the driver and people on the sidewalk, several critically, had only damaged the carriage. It was bulletproof, a gift from <PERSON>Napoleon III</PERSON> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. The tsar emerged shaken but unhurt. <PERSON>Rysakov</PERSON> was captured almost immediately. Police Chief <PERSON>Dvorzhitsky</PERSON> heard <PERSON>Rysakov</PERSON> shout out to someone in the gathering crowd. Realizing there was another (if not more than one) bomber near by he urged the tsar to leave the area at once. <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> agreed to do so but only after he had been shown the site of the explosion. Completely surrounded by the guards and the Cossacks, the tsar made his way over to the hole in the street. It was then that a young man, <PERSON>Ignacy Hryniewiecki</PERSON>, standing by the canal fence, raised up both arms and threw something at the tsar's feet. <PERSON>Dvorzhitsky</PERSON> was later to write:

"I was deafened by the new explosion, burned, wounded and thrown to the ground. Suddenly, amid the smoke and snowy fog, I heard His Majesty's weak voice cry, 'Help!' Gathering what strength I had, I jumped up and rushed to the tsar. His Majesty was half-lying, half-sitting, leaning on his right arm. Thinking he was merely wounded heavily, I tried to lift him but the tsar's legs were shattered, and the blood poured out of them. Twenty people, with wounds of varying degree, lay on the sidewalk and on the street. Some managed to stand, others to crawl, still others tried to get out from beneath bodies that had fallen on them. Through the snow, debris, and blood you could see fragments of clothing, epaulets, sabers, and bloody chunks of human flesh."

Later it was learned there was a third bomber in the crowd. <PERSON>Ivan Emelyanov</PERSON> stood ready, clutching a briefcase containing a bomb that would be used if the other two bombs, and bombers, failed.

<PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> was carried by sleigh to the Winter Palace, up the marble staircase, a trail of blood in his wake, and in to his study where, twenty years before almost to the date, he had signed the Emancipation Edict freeing the serfs. <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> with both legs destroyed, was bleeding to death. Members of the <PERSON>Romanov</PERSON> family came rushing to the scene. One of them was the quiet, sensitive thirteen year old boy named <PERSON>Nicky</PERSON>, elder son of the heir-apparent <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON>; the boy would grow up to be tsar in his own right, <PERSON>Nicholas II</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>.

The dying tsar was given Communion and Extreme Unction. There was nothing to do now but wait. When asked how long it would be, the attending physician Dr. <PERSON>S.P. Borkin</PERSON> replied, "Up to fifteen minutes"At 3:30 that day the standard of <PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON> was lowered for the last time.

The assassination also caused a great setback for the reform movement. One of <PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON>'s last ideas was to draft up plans for an elected parliament, or <ORGANIZATION>Duma</ORGANIZATION>, which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. The first action <PERSON>Alexander III</PERSON> took after his coronation was to tear up those plans. A <ORGANIZATION>Duma</ORGANIZATION> would not come into fruition until 1905, by <PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON>'s grandson, <PERSON>Nicholas II</PERSON>, who commissioned the <ORGANIZATION>Duma</ORGANIZATION> following heavy pressure on the monarchy by the Russian Revolution of 1905.

A second consequence of the assassination was anti-Jewish pogroms and legislation. Despite the fact only one Jew was involved in the assassination conspiracy, over 200 Jews who had nothing to do with the murder of <PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON> were beaten to death in these pogroms.

A third consequence of the assassination was that suppression of civil liberties in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and police brutality burst back with a full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of <PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON>. <PERSON>Alexander II</PERSON>'s murder and subsequent death was witnessed firsthand by his son, <PERSON>Alexander III</PERSON>, and his grandson, <PERSON>Nicholas II</PERSON>, both future Tsars, who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people.

<TITLE><PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</LOCATION> (January 17, 1706 [O.S. January 6, 1705] April 17, 1790) was one of the Founding Fathers of the <LOCATION>United States of America</LOCATION>. A noted polymath, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was a leading author and printer, satirist, political theorist, politician, scientist, inventor, civic activist, statesman and diplomat. As a scientist he was a major figure in the Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He invented the lightning rod, bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, and a musical instrument. He formed both the first public lending library in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> and first fire department in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>. He was an early proponent of colonial unity and as a political writer and activist he, more than anyone, invented the idea of an American nation and as a diplomat during the American Revolution, he secured the French alliance that helped to make independence possible.

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> is credited as being foundational to the roots of American values and character, a marriage of the practical and democratic Puritan values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment. In the words of <PERSON>Henry Steele Commager</PERSON>, "In <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat." To <PERSON>Walter Isaacson</PERSON>, this makes <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>, "the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> would become."

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> became a newspaper editor, printer, and merchant in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, becoming very wealthy, writing and publishing Poor <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>'s Almanack and the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Gazette. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was interested in science and technology, and gained international renown for his famous experiments. He played a major role in establishing the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania and Franklin & Marshall College</ORGANIZATION> and was elected the first president of the <ORGANIZATION>American Philosophical Society</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> became a national hero in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> when he spearheaded the effort to have <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the <LOCATION>French</LOCATION> as American minister to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco-American relations. From 1775 to 1776, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was Postmaster General under the <ORGANIZATION>Continental Congress</ORGANIZATION> and from 1785 to 1788 was President of the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>. Toward the end of his life, he became one of the most prominent abolitionists.

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and status as one of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s most influential Founding Fathers, has seen <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> honored on coinage and money; warships; the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, namesakes, and companies; and more than two centuries after his death, countless cultural references.

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s father, <PERSON>Josiah Franklin</PERSON>, was born at <LOCATION>Ecton</LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Northamptonshire</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> on December 23, 1657, the son of <PERSON>Thomas Franklin</PERSON>, a blacksmith and farmer, and <PERSON>Jane White</PERSON>. His mother, <PERSON>Abiah Folger</PERSON>, was born in <LOCATION>Nantucket</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, on August 15, 1667, to <PERSON>Peter Folger</PERSON>, a miller and schoolteacher and his wife <PERSON>Mary Morrill</PERSON>, a former indentured servant. A descendant of the Folgers, <PERSON>J.A. Folger</PERSON>, founded <ORGANIZATION>Folgers Coffee</ORGANIZATION> in the 19th century.

<PERSON>Josiah Franklin</PERSON> had seventeen children by his two wives. His first wife was <PERSON>Anne Child</PERSON>, whom he married about 1677 in <LOCATION>Ecton</LOCATION> and immigrated to <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> with in 1683; they had three children before immigrating, and four after. After her death, <PERSON>Josiah</PERSON> was married to <PERSON>Abiah Folger</PERSON> on July 9, 1689 in the Old South Meeting House by <PERSON>Samuel Willard</PERSON>. <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON>, their eighth child, was <PERSON>Josiah Franklin</PERSON>'s fifteenth child and tenth and last son.

<PERSON>Josiah Franklin</PERSON> converted to the Puritanism in the 1670s. Puritanism was a <ORGANIZATION>Protestant</ORGANIZATION> movement in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> to "purify" Anglicanism from elements of the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic</ORGANIZATION> religion, which they considered superstitious. Three things were important to the Puritans: that each congregation would be self-governing, that ministers give sermons instead of performing rituals such as a Mass and individual Bible study so that each believer could develop a personal understanding and relationship with God. Puritanism appealed to smart, middle-class people such as <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON>'s father, who enjoyed the governance meetings, discussion, study and personal independence.

The roots of American democracy can be seen in these Puritan values of self-government, the importance of the individual and active indignation against unjust authority, which were passed on to <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON> and other founding fathers such as <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON>. One of <PERSON>Josiah</PERSON>'s core Puritan values was that personal worth is earned through hard work, which makes the industrious man the equal of kings, which <PERSON>Ben Franklin</PERSON> etched onto his father's tombstone, from his father <PERSON>Josiah</PERSON>'s favorite Bible quote, from the Hebrew Bible, Proverbs 22:29: "Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand before <ORGANIZATION>Kings</ORGANIZATION>." Hard work and equality were two Puritan values <PERSON>Ben Franklin</PERSON> preached throughout his own life (ibid, p 78) and spread widely through Poor <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>'s Almanac and his autobiography.

<PERSON>Ben Franklin</PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON>Abiah Folger</PERSON>, was born into a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> for religious freedom, when King Charles I of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> began persecuting Protestants. They sailed for <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> in 1635. Her father was "the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>." As clerk of the court, he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle-class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners. <PERSON>Ben Franklin</PERSON> followed in his grandfather's footsteps in his battles against the wealthy <PERSON>Penn</PERSON> family that owned the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Colony.



<PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON> was born on Milk Street, in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>, on January 17, 1706 and baptized at Old South Meeting House. His father, <PERSON>Josiah Franklin</PERSON>, was a tallow chandler, a maker of candles and soap, whose second wife, <PERSON>Abiah Folger</PERSON>, was <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON>'s mother. <PERSON>Josiah</PERSON>'s marriages produced 17 children; <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> was the fifteenth child and youngest son. <PERSON>Josiah</PERSON> wanted <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> to attend school with the clergy but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended <ORGANIZATION>Boston Latin School</ORGANIZATION> but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although "his parents talked of the church as a career" for <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>, his schooling ended when he was ten. He then worked for his father for a time and at 12 he became an apprentice to his brother <PERSON>James</PERSON>, a printer, who taught <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> the printing trade. When <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> was 15, <PERSON>James</PERSON> created the <LOCATION>New England Courant</LOCATION>, the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies. When denied the option to write to the paper, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> invented the pseudonym of "Mrs. <PERSON>Silence Dogood</PERSON>," who was ostensibly a middle-aged widow. The letters were published in the paper and became a subject of conversation around town. Neither <PERSON>James</PERSON> nor the Courant's readers were aware of the ruse, and <PERSON>James</PERSON> was unhappy with <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> left his apprenticeship without permission and in so doing became a fugitive.

At age 17, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> ran away to <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, seeking a new start in a new city. When he first arrived he worked in several printer shops around town. However, he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects. After a few months, while working in a printing house, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was convinced by <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Governor Sir <PERSON>William Keith</PERSON> to go to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. Finding <PERSON>Keith</PERSON>'s promises of backing a newspaper to be empty, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> worked as a compositor in a printer's shop in what is now the <ORGANIZATION>Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Smithfield</ORGANIZATION> area of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Following this, he returned to <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> in 1726 with the help of a merchant named <PERSON>Thomas Denham</PERSON>, who gave <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> a position as clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in <PERSON>Denham</PERSON>'s merchant business.

In 1727, <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON>, 21, created the Junto, a group of "like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community." The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>.

Reading was a great pastime of the Junto, but books were rare and expensive. The members created a library, and initially pooled their own books together. This did not work, however, and <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> initiated the idea of a subscription library, where the members pooled their monetary resources to buy books. This idea was the birth of the <ORGANIZATION>Library Company</ORGANIZATION>, with the charter of the <ORGANIZATION>Library Company</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> created in 1731 by <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> hired the first American librarian in 1732, <PERSON>Louis Timothee</PERSON>. 

Originally, the books were kept in the homes of the first librarians, but in 1739 the collection was moved to the second floor of the <ORGANIZATION>State House</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, now known as Independence Hall. In 1791, a new building was built specifically for the library. The Library Company flourished with no competition and gained many priceless collections from bibliophiles such as <PERSON>James Logan</PERSON> and his physician brother <PERSON>William</PERSON>. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and research library with 500,000 rare books, pamphlets, and broadsides, more than 160,000 manuscripts, and 75,000 graphic items.

Upon <PERSON>Denham</PERSON>'s death, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> returned to his former trade. By 1730, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> had set up a printing house of his own and had contrived to become the publisher of a newspaper called The <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Gazette. The Gazette gave <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, together with a great deal of savvy about cultivating a positive image of an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect; though even after <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious '<PERSON>B. Franklin</PERSON>, Printer.'

In 1731, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was initiated into the local Freemason lodge, becoming a grand master in 1734, indicating his rapid rise to prominence in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>. That same year, he edited and published the first Masonic book in the <LOCATION>Americas</LOCATION>, a reprint of <PERSON>James Anderson</PERSON>'s Constitutions of the Free-Masons. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> remained a Freemason throughout the rest of his life.

In 1724, while a boarder in the Read home, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> had courted <PERSON>Deborah Read</PERSON> before going to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> at Governor <PERSON>Keith</PERSON>'s request. At that time, Miss Read's mother was wary of allowing her daughter to wed a seventeen-year old who was on his way to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. Her own husband having recently died, Mrs. <PERSON>Read</PERSON> declined <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s offer of marriage.

While <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Deborah</PERSON> married a man named <PERSON>John Rodgers</PERSON>. This proved to be a regrettable decision. <PERSON>Rodgers</PERSON> shortly avoided his debts and prosecution by fleeing to <LOCATION>Barbados</LOCATION>, leaving <PERSON>Deborah</PERSON> behind. With <PERSON>Rodgers</PERSON>' fate unknown, and bigamy illegal, <PERSON>Deborah</PERSON> was not free to remarry.

In 1730, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> acknowledged an illegitimate son named <PERSON>William</PERSON>, who would eventually become the last Loyalist governor of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>. While the identity of <PERSON>William</PERSON>'s mother remains unknown, perhaps the responsibility of an infant child gave <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> a reason to take up residence with <PERSON>Deborah Read</PERSON>. <PERSON>William</PERSON> was raised in the Franklin household but eventually broke with his father over the treatment of the colonies at the hands of the crown. However, he was not above using his father's fame to enhance his own standing.

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> established a common-law marriage with <PERSON>Deborah Read</PERSON> on September 1, 1730. In addition to raising <PERSON>William</PERSON>, <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Deborah Franklin</PERSON> had two children together. The first, <PERSON>Francis Folger Franklin</PERSON>, born October 1732, died of smallpox in 1736. <PERSON>Sarah Franklin</PERSON>, nicknamed <PERSON>Sally</PERSON>, was born in 1743. She eventually married <PERSON>Richard Bache</PERSON>, had seven children, and cared for her father in his old age.

<PERSON>Deborah</PERSON>'s fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> on any of his extended trips to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, despite his repeated requests. However, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> did not leave <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to visit <PERSON>Deborah</PERSON> even after she wrote to him in November 1769 saying her illness was due to dissatisfied distress because of his prolonged absence. <PERSON>Deborah Read Franklin</PERSON> died of a stroke in 1774, while <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> was on an extended trip to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>.

In 1733, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> began to publish the famous Poor <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>'s Almanack (with content both original and borrowed) under the pseudonym <PERSON>Richard Saunders</PERSON>, on which much of his popular reputation is based. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> frequently wrote under pseudonyms. Although it was no secret that <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was the author, his <PERSON>Richard Saunders</PERSON> character repeatedly denied it. "Poor <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>'s Proverbs," adages from this almanac, such as "A penny saved is twopence dear" (often misquoted as "A penny saved is a penny earned"), "Fish and visitors stink in three days" remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s readers became well prepared. He sold about ten thousand copies per year (a circulation equivalent to nearly three million today).

In 1758, the year in which he ceased writing for the Almanack, he printed <PERSON>Father Abraham</PERSON>'s Sermon, also known as The Way to Wealth. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s autobiography, published after his death, has become one of the classics of the genre.



<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was a prodigious inventor. Among his many creations were the lightning rod, the glass harmonica, the Franklin stove, bifocal glasses, and the flexible urinary catheter. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> never patented his inventions; in his autobiography he wrote, "... as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously." His inventions also included social innovations, such as paying forward.

As deputy postmaster, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> became interested in the <LOCATION>North Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> circulation patterns which carried mail ships. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> worked with <PERSON>Timothy Folger</PERSON>, his cousin and experienced <LOCATION>Nantucket</LOCATION> whaler captain, and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the <LOCATION>Gulf Stream</LOCATION>, giving it the name by which it's still known today. It took many years for British sea captains to follow <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s advice on navigating the current, but once they did, they were able to gain two weeks in sailing time.

In 1743, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> founded the <ORGANIZATION>American Philosophical Society</ORGANIZATION> to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories. He began the electrical research that, along with other scientific inquiries, would occupy him for the rest of his life, in between bouts of politics and moneymaking.



In 1748, he retired from printing and went into other businesses. He created a partnership with his foreman, <PERSON>David Hall</PERSON>, which provided <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> with half of the shop's profits for 18 years. This lucrative business arrangement provided leisure time for study, and in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with the educated throughout <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and especially in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.

His discoveries included his investigations of electricity. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> proposed that "vitreous" and "resinous" electricity were not different types of "electrical fluid" (as electricity was called then), but the same electrical fluid under different pressures. He was the first to label them as positive and negative respectively, and he was the first to discover the principle of conservation of charge. In 1750, he published a proposal for an experiment to prove that lightning is electricity by flying a kite in a storm that appeared capable of becoming a lightning storm. On May 10, 1752, <PERSON>Thomas-Franois Dalibard</PERSON> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> conducted <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s experiment (using a -tall iron rod instead of a kite) and extracted electrical sparks from a cloud. On June 15, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> may have possibly conducted his famous kite experiment in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and also successfully extracted sparks from a cloud, although there are theories that suggest he never performed the experiment. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s experiment was not written up until <PERSON>Joseph Priestley</PERSON>'s 1767 History and Present Status of Electricity; the evidence shows that <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was insulated (not in a conducting path, since he would have been in danger of electrocution in the event of a lightning strike). (Others, such as Prof. <PERSON>Georg Wilhelm Richmann</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Saint Petersburg</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>, were electrocuted during the months following <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s experiment.) In his writings, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> indicates that he was aware of the dangers and offered alternative ways to demonstrate that lightning was electrical, as shown by his use of the concept of electrical ground. If <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> did perform this experiment, he did not do it in the way that is often described, flying the kite and waiting to be struck by lightning, as it would have been fatal. Instead, he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud, which implied that lightning was electrical.

On October 19 in a letter to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> explaining directions for repeating the experiment, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> wrote:

"When rain has wet the kite twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it streams out plentifully from the key at the approach of your knuckle, and with this key a phial, or <LOCATION>Leiden</LOCATION> jar, maybe charged: and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled, and all other electric experiments [may be] performed which are usually done by the help of a rubber glass globe or tube; and therefore the sameness of the electrical matter with that of lightening completely demonstrated."

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s electrical experiments led to his invention of the lightning rod. He noted that conductors with a sharp rather than a smooth point were capable of discharging silently, and at a far greater distance. He surmised that this knowledge could be of use in protecting buildings from lightning, by attaching "upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground;...Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!" Following a series of experiments on <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s own house, lightning rods were installed on the Academy of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> (later the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>) and the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> State House (later Independence Hall) in 1752.

In recognition of his work with electricity, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> received the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Society</ORGANIZATION>'s Copley Medal in 1753, and in 1756 he became one of the few eighteenth century Americans to be elected as a Fellow of the Society. The cgs unit of electric charge has been named after him: one franklin (Fr) is equal to one statcoulomb.

On October 21, 1743, according to popular myth, a storm moving from the southwest denied <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> the opportunity of witnessing a lunar eclipse. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was said to have noted that the prevailing winds were actually from the northeast, contrary to what he had expected. In correspondence with his brother, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> learned that the same storm had not reached <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> until after the eclipse, despite the fact that <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> is to the northeast of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. He deduced that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing wind, a concept which would have great influence in meteorology.

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> noted a principle of refrigeration by observing that on a very hot day, he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one. To understand this phenomenon more clearly <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> conducted experiments. On one warm day in <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, in 1758, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> and fellow scientist <PERSON>John Hadley</PERSON> experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury thermometer with ether and using bellows to evaporate the ether. With each subsequent evaporation, the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching 7F (-14C). Another thermometer showed the room temperature to be constant at 65F (18C). In his letter "Cooling by Evaporation," <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> noted that "one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summers day."

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> is known to have played the violin, the harp, and the guitar. He also composed music, notably a string quartet in early classical style, and invented a much-improved version of the glass harmonica, in which each glass was made to rotate on its own, with the player's fingers held steady, instead of the other way around; this version soon found its way to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>.

In 1736, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> created the <ORGANIZATION>Union Fire Company</ORGANIZATION>, one of the first volunteer fire fighting companies in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. In the same year, he printed a new currency for <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> based on innovative anti-counterfeiting techniques which he had devised.

As he matured, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> began to concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he set forth a scheme for <ORGANIZATION>The Academy and College</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. He was appointed president of the academy in November 13, 1749, and it opened on August 13, 1751. At its first commencement, on May 17, 1757, seven men graduated; six with a Bachelor of Arts and one as Master of Arts. It was later merged with the <ORGANIZATION>University of</ORGANIZATION> the State of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> to become the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>.

In 1753, both <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> awarded him honorary degrees.

In 1751, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON>Thomas Bond</PERSON> obtained a charter from the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> legislature to establish a hospital. <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Hospital</LOCATION> was the first hospital in what was to become the <LOCATION>United States of America</LOCATION>.



<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> became involved in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> politics and rapidly progressed. In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman, in June 1749 he became a Justice of the Peace for <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, and in 1751 he was elected to the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania Assembly</LOCATION>. On August 10, 1753, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was appointed joint deputy postmaster-general of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION>. His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system, but his fame as a statesman rests chiefly on his subsequent diplomatic services in connection with the relations of the colonies with <LOCATION>Great Britain</LOCATION>, and later with <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>.

In 1754, he headed the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> delegation to the <ORGANIZATION>Albany Congress</ORGANIZATION>. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Trade</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> proposed a broad Plan of Union for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution.

In 1756, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> organized the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Militia (see "Associated Regiment of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>" under heading of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>'s 103rd Artillery and <ORGANIZATION>111th Infantry Regiment</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Continental Army</ORGANIZATION>). He used <PERSON>Tun Tavern</PERSON> as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the Native American uprisings that beset the American colonies. {<PERSON>Reportably Franklin</PERSON> was elected "Colonel" of the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Regiment</ORGANIZATION> but declined the honor}.

In 1757, he was sent to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania Assembly</ORGANIZATION> as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> family, the proprietors of the colony. He remained there for five years, striving to end the proprietors' prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly, and their exemption from paying taxes on their land. His lack of influential allies in <ORGANIZATION>Whitehall</ORGANIZATION> led to the failure of this mission. In 1759, the <ORGANIZATION>University of St Andrews</ORGANIZATION> awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree. In 1762, <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University</ORGANIZATION> awarded <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> an honorary doctorate for his scientific accomplishments and from then on he went by "Doctor <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>." He also managed to secure a post for his illegitimate son, <PERSON>William Franklin</PERSON>, as Colonial Governor of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>.

During his stay in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> became involved in radical politics. He was a member of the Club of Honest Whigs, alongside thinkers such as <PERSON>Richard Price</PERSON>.

In 1756, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> became a member of the Society for the <ORGANIZATION>Encouragement of Arts</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Manufactures & Commerce</ORGANIZATION> (now <ORGANIZATION>Royal Society of Arts</ORGANIZATION> or RSA, which had been founded in 1754), whose early meetings took place in coffee shops in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Covent Garden</LOCATION> district, close to <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s main residence in <LOCATION>Craven Street</LOCATION> (the only one of his residences to survive and which opened to the public as the <ORGANIZATION>Benjamin Franklin House</ORGANIZATION> museum on January 17, 2006). After his return to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> became the <ORGANIZATION>Society</ORGANIZATION>'s Corresponding Member and remained closely connected with the Society. The RSA instituted a Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA.

During his stays at <LOCATION>Craven Street</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> between 1757 and 1775, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> developed a close friendship with his landlady, <PERSON>Margaret Stevenson</PERSON> and her circle of friends and relations, in particular her daughter <PERSON>Mary</PERSON>, who was more often known as <PERSON>Polly</PERSON>.

In 1759, he visited <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION> with his son, and recalled his conversations there as "the densest happiness of my life."

He also joined the influential <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> based <ORGANIZATION>Lunar Society</ORGANIZATION> with whom he regularly corresponded and on occasion, visited in <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> in the <LOCATION>West Midlands</LOCATION>.



In 1763, soon after <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, the western frontier was engulfed in a bitter war known as <LOCATION>Pontiac</LOCATION>'s Rebellion. The <PERSON>Paxton Boys</PERSON>, a group of settlers convinced that the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> government was not doing enough to protect them from American Indian raids, murdered a group of peaceful Susquehannock Indians and then marched on <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> helped to organize the local militia in order to defend the capital against the mob, and then met with the <PERSON>Paxton</PERSON> leaders and persuaded them to disperse. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> wrote a scathing attack against the racial prejudice of the Paxton Boys. "If an Indian injures me," he asked, "does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all Indians?"

At this time, many members of the <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania Assembly</ORGANIZATION> were feuding with <PERSON>William Penn</PERSON>'s heirs, who controlled the colony as proprietors. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> led the "anti-proprietary party" in the struggle against the <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> family, and was elected Speaker of the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> House in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears, and because of political attacks on his character, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections. The anti-proprietary party dispatched <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> to <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> to continue the struggle against the <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> family proprietorship, but during this visit, events would drastically change the nature of his mission.

In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> opposed the 1765 Stamp Act, but when he was unable to prevent its passage, he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>. Pennsylvanians were outraged, believing that he had supported the measure all along, and threatened to destroy his home in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> soon learned of the extent of colonial resistance to the Stamp Act, and his testimony before the <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> led to its repeal. With this, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> suddenly emerged as the leading spokesman for American interests in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. He wrote popular essays on behalf of the colonies, and <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>, and <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> also appointed him as their agent to the Crown.



In September 1767, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> visited <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> with his usual traveling partner, Sir <PERSON>John Pringle</PERSON>. News of his electrical discoveries was widespread in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. His reputation meant that he was introduced to many influential scientists and politicians, and also to <LOCATION>King Louis</LOCATION> XV.

While living in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in 1768, he developed a phonetic alphabet in A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling. This reformed alphabet discarded six letters <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own. His new alphabet, however, never caught on and he eventually lost interest.

In 1771, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> traveled extensively around the <LOCATION>British Isles</LOCATION> staying with, among others, <PERSON>Joseph Priestley</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Hume</PERSON>. In <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was invited to sit with the members of the Irish <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to be given this honor. While touring <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>, he was moved by the level of poverty he saw. <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION>'s economy was affected by the same trade regulations and laws of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> which governed <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> feared that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> could suffer the same effects should Britains colonial exploitation continue.

In 1773, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> published two of his most celebrated pro-American satirical essays: , and An Edict by the King of <LOCATION>Prussia</LOCATION>. He also published an Abridgment of the Book of Common Prayer, anonymously with <PERSON>Francis Dashwood</PERSON>. Among the unusual features of this work is a funeral service reduced to six minutes in length, "to preserve the health and lives of the living."

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> obtained private letters of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> governor <PERSON>Thomas Hutchinson</PERSON> and lieutenant governor <PERSON>Andrew Oliver</PERSON> which proved they were encouraging <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to crack down on the rights of the Bostonians. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> sent them to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> where they escalated the tensions. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> now appeared to the British as the fomenter of serious trouble. Hopes for a peaceful solution ended as he was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by the <ORGANIZATION>Privy Council</ORGANIZATION>. He left <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in March 1775.



By the time <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> on May 5, the American Revolution had begun with fighting at <LOCATION>Lexington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Concord</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> militia had trapped the main British army in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION>. The <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Assembly unanimously chose <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> as their delegate to the <ORGANIZATION>Second Continental Congress</ORGANIZATION>. In June 1776, he was appointed a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee of Five</ORGANIZATION> that drafted the Declaration of Independence. Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> made several small changes to the draft sent to him by <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON>.

At the signing, he is quoted as having replied to a comment by <PERSON>Hancock</PERSON> that they must all hang together: "Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately."

In December 1776, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was dispatched to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> as commissioner for the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. He lived in a home in the <LOCATION>Parisian</LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION>Passy</LOCATION>, donated by <PERSON>Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont</PERSON> who supported the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> remained in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> until 1785, and was such a favorite of French society that it became fashionable for wealthy French families to decorate their parlors with a painting of him. He was highly flirtatious in the French manner (but did not have any actual affairs). He conducted the affairs of his country towards the French nation with great success, which included securing a critical military alliance in 1778 and negotiating the Treaty of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> (1783). During his stay in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON> as a freemason was Grand Master of the <ORGANIZATION>Lodge Les Neuf Surs</ORGANIZATION> from 1779 until 1781. His number was 24 in the Lodge. He was also a Past Grand Master of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>. In 1784, when <PERSON>Franz Mesmer</PERSON> began to publicize his theory of "animal magnetism", which was considered offensive by many, <PERSON>Louis XVI</PERSON> appointed a commission to investigate it. These included the chemist <PERSON>Antoine Lavoisier</PERSON>, the physician <PERSON>Joseph-Ignace Guillotin</PERSON>, the astronomer <PERSON>Jean Sylvain Bailly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON>.

When he finally returned home in 1785, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> occupied a position only second to that of <PERSON>George Washington</PERSON> as the champion of American independence. <PERSON>Le Ray</PERSON> honored him with a commissioned portrait painted by <PERSON>Joseph Duplessis</PERSON> that now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of the <ORGANIZATION>Smithsonian Institution</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C</LOCATION>. After his return, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> became an abolitionist, freeing both of his slaves. He eventually became president of the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Abolition Society.

In 1787, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> served as a delegate to the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> Convention. He held an honorific position and seldom engaged in debate. He is the only Founding Father who is a signatory of all four of the major documents of the founding of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>: the Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, the Treaty of Alliance with <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> Constitution.

In 1787, a group of prominent ministers in <LOCATION>Lancaster</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION>, proposed the foundation of a new college to be named in <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s honor. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> donated 200 towards the development of <ORGANIZATION>Franklin College</ORGANIZATION>, which is now called <ORGANIZATION>Franklin & Marshall College</ORGANIZATION>.

Between 1771 and 1788, he finished his autobiography. While it was at first addressed to his son, it was later completed for the benefit of mankind at the request of a friend.

In his later years, as <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> was forced to deal with the issue of slavery, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> wrote several essays that attempted to convince his readers of the importance of the abolition of slavery and of the integration of Africans into American society. These writings included:

In 1790, Quakers from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> presented their petition for abolition. Their argument against slavery was backed by the <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society</ORGANIZATION> and its president, <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON>.

Special balloting conducted October 18, 1785 unanimously elected <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> the sixth President of the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION>, replacing <PERSON>John Dickinson</PERSON>. The office of President of <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> was analogous to the modern position of Governor. It is not clear why <PERSON>Dickinson</PERSON> needed to be replaced with less than two weeks remaining before the regular election. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> held that office for slightly over three years, longer than any other, and served the Constitutional limit of three full terms. Shortly after his initial election he was re-elected to a full term on October 29, 1785, and again in the fall of 1786 and on October 31, 1787. Officially, his term concluded on November 5, 1788, but there is some question regarding the de facto end of his term, suggesting that the aging Franklin may not have been actively involved in the day-to-day operation of the Council toward the end of his time in office.



Like the other advocates of republicanism, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> emphasized that the new republic could survive only if the people were virtuous in the sense of attention to civic duty and rejection of corruption. All his life he had been exploring the role of civic and personal virtue, as expressed in Poor <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>'s aphorisms.

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> had been baptized and educated in a Presbyterian Church based on the doctrines of <PERSON>John Calvin</PERSON>. <PERSON>Deborah Franklin</PERSON>, his wife, retained a life long association with <ORGANIZATION>Christ Church</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> later in life rarely attended Sunday services but commented that "...Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that He made the world, and governed it by His providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter."

One of <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s endearing beliefs was in the respect and tolerance of all religious groups. Referring to his experience in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, he wrote in his autobiography, "new Places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary Contribution, my Mite for such purpose, whatever might be the Sect, was never refused."

Although <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s parents had intended for him to have a career in the church, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> became disillusioned with organized religion after discovering Deism. "I soon became a thorough Deist." He went on to attack Christian principles of free will and morality in a 1725 pamphlet, A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain. He consistently attacked religious dogma, arguing that morality was more dependent upon virtue and benevolent actions than on strict obedience to religious orthodoxy: "I think opinions should be judged by their influences and effects; and if a man holds none that tend to make him less virtuous or more vicious, it may be concluded that he holds none that are dangerous, which I hope is the case with me."

In 1790, just about a month before he died, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> wrote the following in a letter to <PERSON>Ezra Stiles</PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, who had asked him his views on religion:



Like most Enlightenment intellectuals, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> separated virtue, morality, and faith from organized religion, although he felt that if religion in general grew weaker, morality, virtue, and society in general would also decline. Thus he wrote <PERSON>Thomas Paine</PERSON>, "If men are so wicked with religion, what would they be if without it." According to <PERSON>David Morgan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was a proponent of all religions. He prayed to "Powerful Goodness" and referred to God as the "INFINITE." <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> noted that <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was a mirror in which people saw their own religion: "The Catholics thought him almost a Catholic. <ORGANIZATION>The Church of England</ORGANIZATION> claimed him as one of them. The Presbyterians thought him half a Presbyterian, and the Friends believed him a wet Quaker." Whatever else <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON> was, concludes <PERSON>Morgan</PERSON>, "he was a true champion of generic religion." <PERSON>Ben Franklin</PERSON> was noted to be "the spirit of the Enlightenment."

<PERSON>Walter Isaacson</PERSON> argues that <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> became uncomfortable with an unenhanced version of Deism and came up with his own conception of the Creator. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> outlined his concept of deity in 1728, in his Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion. From this, <PERSON>Isaacson</PERSON> compares <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s conception of deity to that of strict Deists and orthodox Christians. He concludes that unlike most pure Deists, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> believed that a faith in God should inform our daily actions, but that, like other Deists, his faith was devoid of sectarian dogma. <PERSON>Isaacson</PERSON> also discusses <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s conception that God had created beings who do interfere in wordly matters, a point that has led some commentators, most notably <PERSON>A. Owen Aldridge</PERSON>, to read <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> as embracing some sort of polytheism, with a bevy of lesser gods overseeing various realms and planets.

On July 4, 1776, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> appointed a committee that included <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON>, <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON>, and <PERSON>John Adams</PERSON> to design the Great Seal of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Each member of the committee proposed a unique design: <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s proposal featured a design with the motto: "Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God." This design was to portray a scene from the Book of Exodus, complete with <PERSON>Moses</PERSON>, the Israelites, the pillar of fire, and <PERSON>George III</PERSON> depicted as Pharaoh.

Franklin may have financially supported one particular Presbyterian group in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. According to the epitaph <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> wrote for himself at the age of twenty, it is clear that he believed in a physical resurrection of the body some time after death. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads "<PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Deborah Franklin</PERSON>."

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> sought to cultivate his character by a plan of thirteen virtues, which he developed at age 20 (in 1726) and continued to practice in some form for the rest of his life. His autobiography lists his thirteen virtues as:

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> didn't try to work on them all at once. Instead, he would work on one and only one each week "leaving all others to their ordinary chance". While <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> didn't live completely by his virtues and by his own admission, he fell short of them many times, he believed the attempt made him a better man contributing greatly to his success and happiness, which is why in his Autobiography, he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point; in his autobiography <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> wrote, "I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit."



<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> died on April 17, 1790, at age 84. His funeral was attended by approximately 20,000 people. He was interred in Christ Church Burial Ground in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. In 1728, aged 22, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph:

The Body of B. Franklin Printer; Like the Cover of an old Book, Its Contents torn out, And stript of its Lettering and Gilding, Lies here, Food for Worms. But the Work shall not be wholly lost: For it will, as he believ'd, appear once more, In a new & more perfect Edition, Corrected and Amended By the Author.

<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads "<PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Deborah Franklin</PERSON>."

In 1773, when <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s work had moved from printing to science and politics, he corresponded with a French scientist on the subject of preserving the dead for later revival by more advanced scientific methods, writing:

I should prefer to an ordinary death, being immersed with a few friends in a cask of <LOCATION>Madeira</LOCATION>, until that time, then to be recalled to life by the solar warmth of my dear country! But in all probability, we live in a century too little advanced, and too near the infancy of science, to see such an art brought in our time to its perfection. (Extended excerpt also online.)

His death is described in the book The Life of <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON>, quoting from the account of Dr. <PERSON>John Jones</PERSON>:

...when the pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him, and his family were flattering themselves with the hopes of his recovery, when an imposthume, which had formed itself in his lungs, suddenly burst, and discharged a quantity of matter, which he continued to throw up while he had power; but, as that failed, the organs of respiration became gradually oppressed; a calm, lethargic state succeeded; and on the 17th instant (April, 1790), about eleven o'clock at night, he quietly expired, closing a long and useful life of eighty-four years and three months.



<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> bequeathed 1,000 (about $4,400 at the time) each to the cities of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>, in trust to gather interest for 200 years. The trust began in 1785 when a French mathematician named <PERSON>Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour</PERSON> wrote a parody of <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s "Poor <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>'s Almanack" called "Fortunate <PERSON>Richard</PERSON>." Mocking the unbearable spirit of American optimism represented by <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>, the Frenchman wrote that Fortunate <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> left a small sum of money in his will to be used only after it had collected interest for 500 years. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>, who was 79 years old at the time, wrote to the Frenchman, thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1,000 pounds each to his native <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and his adopted <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>. As of 1990, more than $2,000,000 had accumulated in <LOCATION>Franklin</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> trust, which had loaned the money to local residents. From 1940 to 1990, the money was used mostly for mortgage loans. When the trust came due, <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time, and was used to establish a trade school that became the <ORGANIZATION>Franklin Institute of Boston</ORGANIZATION>.

A signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> is considered one of the Founding Fathers of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> His pervasive influence in the early history of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has led to his being called "the only President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> who was never President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>." <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s likeness is ubiquitous. Since 1928, it has adorned American $100 bills, which are sometimes referred to in slang as "Benjamins" or "Franklins." From 1948 to 1964, <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s portrait was on the half dollar. He has appeared on a $50 bill and on several varieties of the $100 bill from 1914 and 1918. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> appears on the $1,000 Series EE Savings bond. The city of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> contains around 5,000 likenesses of <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON>, about half of which are located on the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> campus. <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin Parkway</PERSON> (a major thoroughfare) and <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin Bridge</PERSON> (the first major bridge to connect <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> with <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION>) are named in his honor.



In 1976, as part of a bicentennial celebration, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> dedicated a 20-foot (6 m) marble statue in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Franklin Institute</ORGANIZATION> as the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial. Many of <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>'s personal possessions are also on display at the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION>, one of the few national memorials located on private property.

In <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, his house at 36 <LOCATION>Craven Street</LOCATION> was first marked with a blue plaque and has since been opened to the public as the <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin House</PERSON>. In 1998, workmen restoring the building dug up the remains of six children and four adults hidden below the home. The Times reported on February 11, 1998:

Initial estimates are that the bones are about 200 years old and were buried at the time <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was living in the house, which was his home from 1757 to 1762 and from 1764 to 1775. Most of the bones show signs of having been dissected, sawn or cut. One skull has been drilled with several holes. <PERSON>Paul Knapman</PERSON>, the <PERSON>Westminster Coroner</PERSON>, said yesterday: "I cannot totally discount the possibility of a crime. There is still a possibility that I may have to hold an inquest."

The Friends of <ORGANIZATION>Benjamin Franklin House</ORGANIZATION> (the organization responsible for the restoration) note that the bones were likely placed there by <PERSON>William Hewson</PERSON>, who lived in the house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school at the back of the house. They note that while <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> likely knew what <PERSON>Hewson</PERSON> was doing, he probably did not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man.

"The Princess and the Patriot: <PERSON>Ekaterina Dashkova</PERSON>, <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON> and the Age of Enlightenment" exhibition opened in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> in February 2006 and ran through December 2006. <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dashkova</PERSON> met only once, in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> in 1781. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> was 75 and <PERSON>Dashkova</PERSON> was 37. <PERSON>Franklin</PERSON> invited <PERSON>Dashkova</PERSON> to become the first woman to join the <ORGANIZATION>American Philosophical Society</ORGANIZATION> and the only woman to be so honored for another 80 years. Later, <PERSON>Dashkova</PERSON> reciprocated by making him the first American member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.





<PERSON>Franklin</PERSON>, in his "Poor Richard" persona, helped create popular culture in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>. In turn he has been included in many different popular culture media, of which this list is a small, recent sample.

<TITLE><PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON> (December 29, 1808 July 31, 1875) was the seventeenth President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> (1865-69), succeeding to the Presidency upon the assassination of <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>. He was one of only two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Presidents to be impeached.

At the time of the secession of the Southern states, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Senator from Greeneville in eastern <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>. As a Unionist, he was the only southern Senator not to quit his post upon secession. He became the most prominent War Democrat from the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and supported the military policies of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> during the American Civil War of 18611865. In 1862 <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> appointed <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> military governor of occupied <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, where he proved to be energetic and effective in fighting the rebellion and beginning transition to Reconstruction.

<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was nominated for the Vice President slot in 1864 on the <ORGANIZATION>National Union Party</ORGANIZATION> ticket. He and <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> were elected in November 1864. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> succeeded to the Presidency upon <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s assassination on April 15, 1865.

As president he took charge of Presidential Reconstruction the first phase of Reconstruction which lasted until the Radical Republicans gained control of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in the 1866 elections. His conciliatory policies towards the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>, his hurry to reincorporate the former Confederates back into the union, and his vetoes of civil rights bills embroiled him in a bitter dispute with some Republicans. The Radicals in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> impeached him in 1868 while charging him with violating the Tenure of Office Act, a law enacted by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in March 1867 over <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s veto, but he was acquitted by a single vote in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.

<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was born on December 29, 1808, in <LOCATION>Raleigh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>, to <PERSON>Jacob Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary McDonough</PERSON>. <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON>'s father, <PERSON>Jacob</PERSON>, died when <PERSON>Andrew</PERSON> was around three years old, leaving his family in poverty. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s mother then took in work spinning and weaving to support her family and later remarried. She bound <PERSON>Andrew</PERSON> as an apprentice tailor when he was 14 or 10. In the 1820s, he worked as a tailor in <LOCATION>Laurens</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> never attended any type of school and taught himself how to read and spell.

At age 16 or 17 <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> broke his apprenticeship and ran away with his brother to <LOCATION>Greeneville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, where he found work as a tailor. At the age of 18, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> married <PERSON>Eliza McCardle</PERSON> in 1827. Between 1828 and 1852, the couple had five children: <PERSON>Martha</PERSON> (1828), <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> (1830), <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> (1832), <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> (1834), and <PERSON>Andrew Jr.</PERSON> (1852). <PERSON>Eliza</PERSON> taught <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> arithmetic and also tutored him to improve his literacy and writing skills.

<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> participated in debates at the local academy at <LOCATION>Greeneville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> and later organized a workingman's party that elected him as alderman in 1829. He served in this position until he was elected mayor in 1833. In 1835 he was elected to the <ORGANIZATION>Tennessee House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> where, after serving a single term, he was defeated for re-election.

<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was attracted to <PERSON>Andrew Jackson</PERSON>'s states' rights <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>. He became a spokesman for the more numerous yeomen farmers and mountaineers against the wealthier, but fewer, planter elite families that had held political control both in the state and nationally. In 1839 <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was elected to the <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, where he served two consecutive two-year terms. In 1843 he became the first Democrat to win election as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Representative from <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>'s 1st congressional district. Among his activities for the common man's interests as a member of the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> advocated 'a free farm for the poor' bill where farms would be given to landless farmers. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Representative for five terms until 1853, when he was elected governor of <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was elected governor of <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, serving from 1853 to 1857. He was then elected as a Democrat to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, serving from October 8, 1857 to March 4, 1862. He was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense (Thirty-sixth <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>). Before <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> voted on secession, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> who lived in Unionist east <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> toured the state speaking in opposition to the act, which he said was unconstitutional. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was an aggressive stump speaker and often responded to hecklers, even those in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. At the time of secession of the Confederacy, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was the only Senator from the seceded states to continue participation in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. His explanation for this decision was "Damn the negroes, I am fighting those traitorous aristocrats, their masters."

<PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> appointed <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> military governor of occupied <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> in March 1862 with the rank of brigadier general. During his three years in this office, he "moved resolutely to eradicate all pro-Confederate influences in the state." This "unwavering commitment to the Union" was a significant factor in his choice as vice-president by <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> vigorously suppressed the Confederates and later spoke out for black suffrage, arguing, "The better class of them will go to work and sustain themselves, and that class ought to be allowed to vote, on the ground that a loyal negro is more worthy than a disloyal white man." According to tradition and local lore, on August 8, 1863, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> freed his personal slaves.

As a leading War Democrat and pro-Union southerner, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was an ideal candidate for the Republicans in 1864 as they enlarged their base to include War Democrats. They changed the party name to the <ORGANIZATION>National Union Party</ORGANIZATION> to reflect this expansion. During the election <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> replaced <PERSON>Hannibal Hamlin</PERSON> as <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s running mate. He was elected Vice President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and was inaugurated March 4, 1865. At the ceremony, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, who had been drinking to offset the pain of typhoid fever (as he explained later), gave a rambling speech and appeared intoxicated to many. In early 1865, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> talked harshly of hanging traitors like <PERSON>Jefferson Davis</PERSON>, which endeared him to the Radicals.

On April 14, 1865, <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> was shot and mortally wounded by <PERSON>John Wilkes Booth</PERSON>, a Confederate sympathizer, while the President was attending a play at <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION>'s Theater. <PERSON>Booth</PERSON>'s plan was to destroy the administration by ordering conspirators to assassinate <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON>William H. Seward</PERSON> that same night. <PERSON>Seward</PERSON> narrowly survived his wounds, while <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> escaped attack as his would-be assassin, <PERSON>George Atzerodt</PERSON>, failed to go through with the plan.

The morning after <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s assassination, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was sworn in as President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on April 15, 1865 by <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s newly appointed Chief Justice <PERSON>Salmon P. Chase</PERSON>. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was the first Vice President to succeed to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Presidency upon the assassination of a President and the third vice president to become a president.

<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> had an ambiguous party status. He attempted to build a party of loyalists under the National Union label, but he did not identify with the two main parties while President--though he did try for the Democratic nomination in 1868. Asked in 1868 why he did not become a Democrat, he said "It is true I am asked why don't I join the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>. Why don't they join me...if I have administered the office of president so well?"

Northern anger over the assassination of <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> and the immense human cost of the war led to demands for harsh policies. Vice President <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON> had taken a hard line and spoke of hanging rebel Confederates. In late April, 1865 he was noted telling an <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> delegation that, "Treason must be made odious... traitors must be punished and impoverished ... their social power must be destroyed." However, when he succeeded <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> as President, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> took a much softer line noting, "I say, as to the leaders, punishment. I also say leniency, reconciliation and amnesty to the thousands whom they have misled and deceived." and ended up pardoning many Confederate leaders and ex-Confederates to maintain their control of Southern state governments, Southern lands, and black people.

His class-based resentment of the rich appeared in a May 1865 statement to <PERSON>W.H. Holden</PERSON>, the man he appointed governor of <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION>: "I intend to confiscate the lands of these rich men whom I have excluded from pardon by my proclamation, and divide the proceeds thereof among the families of the wool hat boys, the Confederate soldiers, whom these men forced into battle to protect their property in slaves." In practice, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was not at all harsh toward the Confederate leaders. He allowed the Southern states to hold elections in 1865, resulting in prominent ex-Confederates being elected to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>; however, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> did not seat them. <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> argued in an increasingly public way about Reconstruction and the manner in which the Southern secessionist states would be readmitted to the Union. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> favored a very quick restoration, similar to the plan of leniency that <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> advocated before his death.

Johnson-appointed governments all passed Black Codes that gave the Freedmen second class status. In response to the Black Codes and worrisome signs of Southern recalcitrance, the Radical Republicans blocked the re-admission of the ex-rebellious states to the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in fall 1865. <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> also renewed the Freedman's <ORGANIZATION>Bureau</ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> vetoed it. Senator <PERSON>Lyman Trumbull</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION>, leader of the moderate Republicans, took affront at the Black Codes. <PERSON>Trumbull</PERSON> proposed the first Civil Rights bill.

Although strongly urged by moderates in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to sign the Civil Rights bill, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. His veto message objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the Freedmen at a time when eleven out of thirty-six States were unrepresented and attempted to fix by Federal law "a perfect equality of the white and black races in every State of the Union." <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> said it was an invasion by Federal authority of the rights of the <LOCATION>States</LOCATION>; it had no warrant in the Constitution and was contrary to all precedents. It was a "stride toward centralization and the concentration of all legislative power in the national government." <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, in a letter to Governor <PERSON>Thomas C. Fletcher</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION>, wrote, "This is a country for white men, and by God, as long as I am President, it shall be a government for white men."

The <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, proclaiming itself the party of white men, north and <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>, aligned with <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>. However the Republicans in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> overrode his veto (the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> by the vote of 33:15, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> by 182:41) and the Civil Rights bill became law.

The last moderate proposal was the Fourteenth Amendment, also authored by moderate <PERSON>Trumbull</PERSON>. It was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but it went much further. It extended citizenship to everyone born in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to Freedmen, and most importantly, created new Federal civil rights that could be protected by Federal courts. It guaranteed the Federal war debt (and promised the Confederate debt would never be paid). <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> used his influence to block the amendment in the states, as three-fourths of the states were required for ratification. (The Amendment was later ratified.)

The moderate effort to compromise with <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> had failed and an all-out political war broke out between the Republicans (both Radical and moderate) on one side, and on the other <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> and his allies in the Democratic party in the North, and the conservative groupings in the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION>. The decisive battle was the election of 1866. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> campaigned vigorously but was widely ridiculed. The Republicans won by a landslide (the Southern states were not allowed to vote), and took full control of Reconstruction. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was almost powerless.

Historian <PERSON>James Ford Rhodes</PERSON> has explained <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s inability to engage in serious negotiations:As Senator <PERSON>Charles Sumner</PERSON> shrewdly said, "the President himself is his own worst counselor, as he is his own worst defender." <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> acted in accordance with his nature. He had intellectual force but it worked in a groove. Obstinate rather than firm it undoubtedly seemed to him that following counsel and making concessions were a display of weakness. At all events from his December message to the veto of the Civil Rights Bill he yielded not a jot to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. The moderate senators and representatives (who constituted a majority of the Union party) asked him for only a slight compromise; their action was really an entreaty that he would unite with them to preserve <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the country from the policy of the radicals.The two projects which <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> had most at heart were the speedy admission of the Southern senators and representatives to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the relegation of the question of 'negro suffrage' to the States themselves. Himself shrinking from the imposition on these communities of the franchise for the colored people, his unyielding position in regard to matters involving no vital principle did much to bring it about. His quarrel with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> prevented the readmission into the Union on generous terms of the members of the late Confederacy; and for the quarrel and its unhappy results <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s lack of imagination and his inordinate sensitiveness to political gadflies were largely responsible: it was not a contest in which fundamentals were involved.He sacrificed two important objects to petty considerations. His pride of opinion, his desire to beat, blinded him to the real welfare of the <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> and of the whole country.

There were two attempts to remove President <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON> from office. The first occurred in the fall of 1867. On November 21, 1867, the <ORGANIZATION>House Judiciary committee</ORGANIZATION> produced a bill of impeachment that consisted of a vast collection of complaints against him. After a furious debate, a formal vote was held in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> on December 5, 1867, which failed 108-57.

<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> notified <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that he had removed <PERSON>Edwin Stanton</PERSON> as Secretary of War and was replacing him in the interim with Adjutant-General <PERSON>Lorenzo Thomas</PERSON>. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> had wanted to replace <PERSON>Stanton</PERSON> with former General <PERSON>Ulysses S. Grant</PERSON>, who refused to accept the position. This violated the Tenure of Office Act, a law enacted by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in March 1867 over <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s veto, specifically designed to protect <PERSON>Stanton</PERSON>. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> had vetoed the act, claiming it was unconstitutional. The act said, "...every person holding any civil office, to which he has been appointed by and with the advice and consent of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> ... shall be entitled to hold such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed and duly qualified," thus removing the President's previous unlimited power to remove any of his Cabinet members at will. Years later in the case <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> v. <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in 1926, the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> ruled that such laws were indeed unconstitutional.

The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> entered into debate. <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> attempted to move into the war office, for which <PERSON>Stanton</PERSON> had <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> arrested. Three days after <PERSON>Stanton</PERSON>'s removal, the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> impeached <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act.

On March 5, 1868, a court of impeachment was constituted in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> to hear charges against the President. <PERSON>William M. Evarts</PERSON> served as his counsel. Eleven articles were set out in the resolution, and the trial before the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> lasted almost three months. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s defense was based on a clause in the Tenure of Office Act stating that the then-current secretaries would hold their posts throughout the term of the President who appointed them. Since <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> had appointed <PERSON>Stanton</PERSON>, it was claimed, the applicability of the act had already run its course.

There were three votes in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>: one on May 16 for the 11th article of impeachment, which included many of the charges contained in the other articles, and two on May 26 for the second and third articles, after which the trial adjourned. On all three occasions, thirty-five Senators voted "guilty" and nineteen "not guilty." As the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority for conviction in impeachment trials, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was acquitted; the 35-19 vote was one less then the majority required. A single changed vote for guilty would have convicted and removed <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> from office. Seven Republican senators were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. Senators <PERSON>William Pitt Fessenden</PERSON>, <PERSON>Joseph S. Fowler</PERSON>, <PERSON>James W. Grimes</PERSON>, <PERSON>John B. Henderson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lyman Trumbull</PERSON>, <PERSON>Peter G. Van Winkle</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Edmund G. Ross</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION>, who provided the decisive vote, defied their party and public opinion and voted against conviction.

Before 1960 most historians held the impeachment of <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON> as a violation of American values regarding division of powers and fair play. Had <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> been successfully removed from office, he would have been replaced with Radical Republican <PERSON>Benjamin Wade</PERSON>, making the presidency and <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> somewhat uniform in ideology, although in many ways <PERSON>Wade</PERSON> was more "radical" than the Republicans in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. This would have established a precedent that a President could be removed not for "high crimes and misdemeanors," but for purely political differences.

One of <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s last significant acts was granting unconditional amnesty to all Confederates on Christmas Day, December 25, 1868. This was after the election of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> to succeed him, but before <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> took office in March 1869. Earlier amnesties requiring signed oaths and excluding certain classes of people were issued both by <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> and by <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>.



<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> forced the French out of <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> by sending a combat army to the border and issuing an ultimatum. The French withdrew in 1867, and the government they supported quickly collapsed. Secretary of State <PERSON>Seward</PERSON> negotiated the purchase of <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> on April 9, 1867 for $7.2 million. Critics sneered at "Seward's Folly" and "Seward's Icebox" and "Icebergia." <PERSON>Seward</PERSON> also negotiated to purchase the Danish West Indies, but the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> refused to approve the purchase in 1867 (it eventually happened in 1917). The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> likewise rejected <PERSON>Seward</PERSON>'s arrangement with the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> to arbitrate the ''<LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION>'' Claims.

The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> experienced tense relations with the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> and its colonial government in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> in the aftermath of the war. Lingering resentment over the perception of British sympathy towards the Confederacy resulted in <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> initially turning a blind eye towards a series of armed incursions by Irish-American civil war veterans into British territory in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>, named the Fenian Raids. Eventually, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> ordered the Fenians disarmed and barred from crossing the border, but his hesitant reaction to the crisis helped motivate the movement toward Canadian Confederation.

<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> in 1868 and to the House of Representatives in 1872. However, in 1874 the <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> legislature did elect him to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> served from March 4, 1875, until his death from a stroke near <LOCATION>Elizabethton</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, on July 31 that same year. In his first speech since returning to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, which was also his last, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> spoke about political turmoil in <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION>. His passion aroused a standing ovation from many of his fellow senators who had once voted to remove him from the presidency. He is the only former President to serve in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>.

Interment was in the <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON> National Cemetery, <LOCATION>Greeneville</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION>, where he was buried with a copy of the Constitution. <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON> National Cemetery is now part of the <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON> National Historic Site.

The <ORGANIZATION>Dunning School</ORGANIZATION> of the early 20th century saw <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> as a heroic bulwark against the corruption of the Radical Republicans who tried to remove the entire leadership class of the white South. In their view, <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> seemed to be the legitimate heir of the sainted <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON>.

By the 1930s a series of favorable biographies enhanced his prestige. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> critics of the 1860s appeared as disreputable to liberal historians as did the <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> critics of <PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON>. Furthermore, a Beardian School (named after <PERSON>Charles Beard</PERSON> and typified by <PERSON>Howard K. Beale</PERSON>) argued that the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> in the 1860s was a tool of corrupt business interests, and that <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> stood for the people. Historian <PERSON>Eric Foner</PERSON> says that by 1948, historians regarded Reconstruction, "as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote." They rated <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> "near great." but have later changed their minds, rating <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> "a flat failure".

The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s brought a new perspective to the practice of history as well as to civil legislation. Historians noted African American efforts to establish public education and welfare institutions, gave muted praise for Republican efforts to extend suffrage and provide other social institutions, and excoriated <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> for siding with the opposition to extending basic rights to former slaves.

<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s purchase of <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> from the Russian Empire in 1867 is believed to be a most important foreign policy action, with the purchase proving itself vital to national security during the Cold War (mid-1940s until the early 1990s). The idea and implementation is credited to <PERSON>Seward</PERSON> as Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> approved the plan. Gold was not discovered in <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> until 1880, thirteen years after the purchase and five years after <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>'s death, and oil was not discovered until 1968.













<TITLE><PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>William Jefferson</PERSON> "Bill" <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> (born <PERSON>William Jefferson Blythe III</PERSON>, August 19, 1946) served as the forty-second President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> from 1993 to 2001. He was the fifteenth Democrat elected to that office. He was the third-youngest president, older only than <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON> and <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>. He became president at the end of the Cold War, and as he was born in the period after World War II, is known as the first Baby Boomer president. His wife is the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Senator, <PERSON>Hillary Rodham Clinton</PERSON>.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was described as a New Democrat and was largely known for the Third Way philosophy of governance that came to epitomize his two terms as president. His policies, on issues such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been described as "centrist." <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> presided over the longest period of peace-time economic expansion in American history, which included a balanced budget and a reported federal surplus. Based on <ORGANIZATION>Congressional</ORGANIZATION> accounting rules, at the end of his presidency <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> reported a surplus of $559 billion. On the heels of a failed attempt at health care reform with a <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Congress</ORGANIZATION>, Republicans won control of the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> for the first time in forty years. Two years later, he was re-elected and became the first member of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON> to win a second term as President. Later he was impeached for obstruction of justice, but subsequently was acquitted by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION>.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> left office with an approval rating at 65%, the highest end of office rating of any President since World War II. Since then, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. To promote and address international causes, such as treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming, he created the <PERSON>William J. Clinton</PERSON> Foundation.

In 2004, he released his autobiography, My Life, and more recently has been involved in his wife <PERSON>Hillary</PERSON>'s 2008 presidential campaign and in that of <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON>.





<PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> was born "<PERSON>William Jefferson Blythe III</PERSON>" in Hope, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>. His father, <PERSON>William Jefferson Blythe, Jr.</PERSON>, was a traveling salesman who died in an automobile accident three months before <PERSON>Bill</PERSON> was born. Following his birth, in order to study nursing, his mother <PERSON>Virginia Dell Cassidy</PERSON> (1923-1994), traveled to <LOCATION>New Orleans</LOCATION>, leaving <PERSON>Bill</PERSON> in Hope with grandparents <PERSON>Eldridge</PERSON> and <PERSON>Edith Cassidy</PERSON>, who owned and operated a small grocery store. At a time when the Southern <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> were racially segregated, <PERSON>Bill</PERSON>'s grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all racial groups. In 1950, <PERSON>Bill</PERSON>'s mother returned from nursing school and shortly thereafter married <PERSON>Roger Clinton</PERSON>, who together with his brother owned an automobile dealership in <LOCATION>Hot Springs</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>. The family moved to <LOCATION>Hot Springs</LOCATION> in 1950.

Although he assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> (as he was known then) turned fourteen that he formally adopted the surname <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, partially as a gesture toward his stepfather. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> says he remembers his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and, at times, his half-brother, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON>, Jr. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.

In Hot Springs, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> attended St. <PERSON>John</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Elementary School</ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION>Ramble Elementary School</ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION>Hot Springs High School</ORGANIZATION> - where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician. He was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life:



In 1963, two influential moments in <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s life contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit to the White House to meet President <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>, as a Boys Nation senator. The other was listening to <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON>'s 1963 I Have a Dream speech (he memorized Dr. <PERSON>King</PERSON>'s words).

With the aid of scholarships, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> attended the <ORGANIZATION>Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION>, receiving a Bachelor of Science in <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Service</ORGANIZATION> (B.S.F.S.) degree in 1968. He spent the summer of 1967, the summer before his senior year, working as an intern for <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> Senator <PERSON>J. William Fulbright</PERSON>. While in college he became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega and was elected to <LOCATION>Phi Beta Kappa</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was also a member of Youth Order of DeMolay, but he never actually became a Freemason. He is a member of <ORGANIZATION>Kappa Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Honorary Band Fraternity, Inc</ORGANIZATION>.

Upon graduation he won a <ORGANIZATION>Rhodes Scholarship to University College</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION> where he studied Government. He developed an interest in rugby union, playing at <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION> and later for the Little Rock Rugby club in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>. While at <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION> he also participated in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War protests, including organizing an October 1969 Moratorium event. In later life he admitted to smoking cannabis at the university, but claimed that he "never inhaled".

After Oxford, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION>Yale Law School</ORGANIZATION> and obtained a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973. While at <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, he began dating law student <PERSON>Hillary Rodham</PERSON> who was a year ahead of him. They married in 1975 and their only child, <PERSON>Chelsea</PERSON>, was born in 1980.

During <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> took a job with the <PERSON>McGovern</PERSON> campaign and was assigned to lead <PERSON>McGovern</PERSON>'s effort in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>. He spent considerable time in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION>, at the <PERSON>McGovern</PERSON> campaign's local headquarters on <LOCATION>Lemmon Avenue</LOCATION> where he had an office. There, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> worked with <PERSON>Ron Kirk</PERSON>, who was later elected mayor of <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> twice, future governor of <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> <PERSON>Ann Richards</PERSON>, and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) <PERSON>Steven Spielberg</PERSON>.

After graduating from <ORGANIZATION>Yale Law School</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> and became a professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Arkansas</ORGANIZATION>. A year later, he ran for the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> in 1974. The incumbent, <PERSON>John Paul Hammerschmidt</PERSON>, defeated <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> by a 52% to 48% margin. Without opposition in the general election, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was elected <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> Attorney General in 1976.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was elected Governor of <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> in 1978, making him the youngest governor in the country at age thirty-two. He worked on educational reform and <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>'s roads, but his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in <LOCATION>Fort Chaffee</LOCATION> in 1980. <PERSON>Monroe Schwarzlose</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Kingsland</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Cleveland County</LOCATION>, polled 31% of the vote against <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested <PERSON>Schwarzlose</PERSON>'s unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s defeat in the general election that year by <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> challenger <PERSON>Frank D. White</PERSON>. As <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> joined friend's <PERSON>Bruce Lindsey</PERSON>'s law firm of <PERSON>Wright</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lindsey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jennings</PERSON>, though he spent most of the next two years working on his re-election campaign. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was again elected governor and kept his job for ten years. He helped <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> transform its economy and significantly improve the state's educational system. He became a leading figure among the New Democrats. The New Democrats, organized within the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> (DLC) were a branch of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> that called for welfare reform and smaller government, a policy supported by both Democrats and Republicans. He served as Chair of the <ORGANIZATION>National Governors Association</ORGANIZATION> from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> made economic growth, job creation and educational improvement high priorities. For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medicine and increased the home property tax exemption. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was responsible for some state educational improvement programs, notably more spending for schools, rising opportunities for gifted children, an increase in vocational education, and raising of teachers' salaries.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s Governorship answered conservative criticism, but personal and business transactions made by the <PERSON>Clintons</PERSON> during this period became the basis of the Whitewater investigation, which dogged his later presidential administration. After very extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the <ORGANIZATION>Clintons</ORGANIZATION> related to the years in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>.

In 1987 there was media speculation <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> would enter the race after then-New York Governor <PERSON>Mario Cuomo</PERSON> declined to run and <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON>Gary Hart</PERSON> withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> decided to remain as <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> governor. For the nomination, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> endorsed <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Governor <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON>. However, he gave the opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, which was nationally-televised, but it was criticized for length. Presenting himself as a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION>, he headed the moderate <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> in 1990 and 1991.

Due to his youthful appearance he was often called the "Boy Governor." In the first contest, the <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> caucus, he finished a very distant third to <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> Senator <PERSON>Tom Harkin</PERSON>. During the campaign for the <ORGANIZATION>New Hampshire Primary</ORGANIZATION> reports of an extramarital affair with <PERSON>Gennifer Flowers</PERSON> surfaced. As <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> fell far behind former <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Senator <PERSON>Paul Tsongas</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> polls, following the Super Bowl, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> and his wife <PERSON>Hillary</PERSON> went on 60 Minutes to refute the charges.

Their television appearance was a calculated risk but <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> regained several delegates. He finished second to <PERSON>Tsongas</PERSON> in the <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. On election night, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> labeled himself "The Comeback Kid." He ended leading New Hampshire by a large percentage. However, <PERSON>Tsongas</PERSON> picked up little or no momentum from his victory.

Winning the big prizes of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> and many of the Southern primaries gave <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> a sizable delegate lead. However, former <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Governor <PERSON>Jerry Brown</PERSON> was scoring victories and <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> had yet to win a significant contest outside of his native South.

With no major Southern state remaining, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> targeted the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> primary, which contained a large number of delegates. He scored a resounding victory in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> and won, shedding his image as a regional candidate. Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> nomination, finishing with a victory in <PERSON>Jerry Brown</PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.





<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> won the 1992 presidential election (43.0% of the vote) against <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON>George H. W. Bush</PERSON> (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire populist <PERSON>H. Ross Perot</PERSON>, who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote) on a platform focusing on domestic issues; a significant part of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s success was <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s steep decline in public approval. Because <PERSON>Bush</PERSON>'s approval ratings were in the 80% range during the <LOCATION>Persian Gulf</LOCATION> conflict, he was described as "unbeatable." However, when <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> compromised with Democrats in an attempt to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his , hurting his approval rating. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> repeatedly condemned <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> for making a promise he failed to keep. By election time, the economy was souring and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> saw his approval rating plummet to slightly over 40%. Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When <PERSON>Pat Buchanan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pat Robertson</PERSON> addressed Christian themesat the Republican National Convention, with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform, many moderates were alienated. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> then pointed to his moderate, "New Democrat" record as governor of <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious. Many Democrats who supported <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in previous elections switched their allegiance to <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>.

His election ended twelve years of <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> rule of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION>, and twenty of the previous twenty four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was the first president to enjoy this windfall since <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> in the late 1970s.

However, during the campaign questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which <PERSON>Hillary Rodham Clinton</PERSON> was a partner, arose. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> maintained questions were moot because all transactions with the state were deducted prior to determining <PERSON>Hillary</PERSON>'s firm pay. Further concern arose when <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> announced that voters would be getting two presidents "for the price of one".





<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on January 20, 1993. In his inaugural address he declared:



Shortly after taking office, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. While this action was popular, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s attempt to fulfill another campaign promise of allowing openly homosexual men and women to serve in the armed forces garnered criticism from the left (for being too tentative in promoting gay rights) and from the right (who opposed any effort to allow gays to serve). After much debate, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> implemented the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, stating as long as homosexuals keep their sexuality secret, they may serve in the military. Some gay rights advocates criticized <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions. These advocates feel <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> should have integrated the military by executive order, noting President <PERSON>Harry Truman</PERSON> used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s defenders argue an executive order might have prompted the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Senate</ORGANIZATION> to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future. Later in his presidency, in 1999, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> said he did not think any serious person could say the way the policy was being implemented was not "out of whack."

The <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration launched the first official <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> website on October 21, 1994. It was followed by three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000. The White House website was part of a wider movement of the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration toward web-based communication. According to <PERSON>Robert Longley</PERSON>, "<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> court system and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military onto the Internet, thus opening up <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s government to more of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> issued Executive Order 13011 Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to fully utilize information technology to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public."



Also in 1993, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> controversially supported ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, along with most of his <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Leadership Committee</ORGANIZATION> allies, strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong intra-party disagreement. Opposition chiefly came from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of <PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON>. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor, 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and signed into law by the President on January 1, 1994.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> signed the <PERSON>Brady Bill</PERSON>, which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low income workers.

One of the most prominent items on <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s legislative agenda was the result of a taskforce headed by <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON>, which was a health care reform plan aimed at achieving universal coverage via a national healthcare plan. Though initially well-received in political circles, it was ultimately doomed by well-organized opposition from conservatives, the <ORGANIZATION>American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>, and the health insurance industry. However, <PERSON>John F. Harris</PERSON>, a biographer of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s, states the program failed because of a lack of co-ordination within the White House. Despite his party holding a majority in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>, the effort to create a national healthcare system ultimately died under heavy public pressure. It was the first major legislative defeat of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s administration.

Two months later, after two years of <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> control, the Democrats lost control of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 in August 1993, which passed <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90% of small businesses, and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2% of taxpayers. Additionally, through the implementation of spending restraints, it mandated the budget be balanced over a number of years.



When several longtime employees of the <ORGANIZATION>White House Travel Office</ORGANIZATION> were fired, the White House travel office controversy began on May 19, 1993. A whistleblower's letter, written during the previous administration, triggered an <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> investigation, which revealed evidence of financial malfeasance. Independent Counsel <PERSON>Kenneth Starr</PERSON> investigated the firings and found no evidence of wrongdoing on the <ORGANIZATION>Clintons</ORGANIZATION>' part.

The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose around improper access to <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> security-clearance documents. <PERSON>Craig Livingstone</PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION>White House Office of Personnel Security</ORGANIZATION>, improperly requested, and received from the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION>, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> administrations. In March 2000, Independent Counsel <PERSON>Robert Ray</PERSON> determined that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity. <PERSON>Ray</PERSON>'s report further stated "there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved" in seeking the files.



The application of the federal death penalty was expanded to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise, by <PERSON>Clintons</PERSON> 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill. During <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s re-election campaign he said, "My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons."

While campaigning for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President, then-Governor <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> to see that <PERSON>Ricky Ray Rector</PERSON> would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, <PERSON>Rector</PERSON> shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but didn't understand the concept of death. According to <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> state and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the claim of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> for the execution was framed in a <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> article as a possible political move to counter "soft on crime" accusations.

According to some sources <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was a death penalty opponent in his early years who switched positions. During <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s term, <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty was re-enacted on March 23, 1973). As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. However, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was the first President to pardon a death row inmate since the federal death penalty was reintroduced in 1988. Federal executions were resumed under his successor <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON>.



In the 1996 presidential election, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was re-elected, receiving 49.2% of the popular vote over Republican <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> (40.7% of the popular vote) and Reform candidate <PERSON>Ross Perot</PERSON> (8.4% of the popular vote), becoming the first Democrat to win presidential reelection since <PERSON>Franklin Roosevelt</PERSON>. The Republicans lost a few seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and gained a few in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION>, but overall retained control of the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> received 379, or over 70% of the <ORGANIZATION>Electoral College</ORGANIZATION> votes, with <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> receiving 159 electoral votes.

The media and prominent Republicans raised controversy over <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s relationship with a 22-year-old White House intern named <PERSON>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON>, resulting in the <PERSON>Lewinsky</PERSON> scandal, on January 21, 1998. In a lame duck session after the 1998 elections, for the belief <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> lied about his relationship with <PERSON>Lewinsky</PERSON> in a sworn deposition in the <PERSON>Paula Jones</PERSON> lawsuit, the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> voted to impeach <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> in 1998, making him the second <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president to be impeached after <PERSON>Andrew Johnson</PERSON>.

The House held no serious impeachment hearings before the mid-term elections. Though the mid-term elections held in November 1998 were at the 6-year point in an 8-year presidency (a time in the electoral cycle where the party holding the White House usually loses Congressional seats) the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> gained several seats. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame duck session in December 1998.



While the <ORGANIZATION>House Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> hearings were perfunctory and ended in a straight party line vote, there was lively debate on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> floor. The two charges passed in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> (largely on the basis of Republican support but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s testimony about his relationship to <PERSON>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON> during a sexual harassment lawsuit (later dismissed, appealed and settled for $850,000) brought by former <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> state employee <PERSON>Paula Jones</PERSON>. The obstruction charge was based on his actions during the subsequent investigation of that testimony. The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> later voted to acquit <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> on both charges. The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> refused to convene to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was represented by <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> law firm <ORGANIZATION>Williams & Connolly</ORGANIZATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> concluded a twenty-one day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote on both counts falling short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an office holder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty. Some Republicans voted not guilty for both charges. On the perjury charge, fifty five senators voted to acquit, including ten Republicans, and forty five voted to convict; on the obstruction charge the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted 5050.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> enacted the Digital Millennium Copyright Act on October 21, 1998. It served as the first significant amendment to the Copyright Act since 1976. The DMCA extended the protection of intellectual property to outlaw reverse engineering of digital protection. It provided a framework for sound recording copyright owners and recording artists to seek public performance royalties under statute, which proved to be a landmark achievement for the recording industry.

Three notable military events occurred during <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s second term. In <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s State of the Union Address, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> warned <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Iraqi</LOCATION> dictator <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON>'s pursuit of nuclear weapons:



To weaken <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON>'s grip of power, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> signed H.R. 4655 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of "regime change" against <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>, though it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces. The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation <PERSON>Desert Fox</PERSON>, lasting from December 16 to December 19, 1998.

The Battle of <LOCATION>Mogadishu</LOCATION> also occurred in <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> in 1993. During the operation, two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets and broadcasted on television news programs. In response, <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> forces were withdrawn from <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> and later conflicts were approached with less soldiers on the ground.

To stop the ethnic cleansing and genocide of Albanians by nationalist Serbians in the former <LOCATION>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</LOCATION>'s province of <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> authorized the use of American troops in a <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> bombing campaign against <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. General <PERSON>Wesley Clark</PERSON> was Supreme Allied Commander of <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> and oversaw the mission. With <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Security Council</ORGANIZATION> Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> administration and authorized a peacekeeping force. <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> claimed to have suffered zero combat deaths, and two deaths from an Apache helicopter crash. Opinions in the popular press criticized pre-war genocide claims by the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration as greatly exaggerated. A <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Court</ORGANIZATION> ruled genocide did not take place, but recognized, "a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments". The term "ethnic cleansing" was used as an alternative to "genocide" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is no difference. <PERSON>Slobodan Miloevi</PERSON>, the President of <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> at the time, was eventually charged with the "murders of about 600 individually identified ethnic Albanians" and "crimes against humanity."

After initial successes such as the <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION> accords of the early 1990s, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> attempted to address the <LOCATION>Arab-Israeli</LOCATION> conflict. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> brought <LOCATION>Israeli</LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Ehud Barak</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Palestinian Authority</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Yasser Arafat</PERSON> together at Camp David. However, the negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful. The situation broke down completely with the start of the Second Intifada.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> became the first president to visit <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> since the end of the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Warin November 2000. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> remained popular with the public throughout his two terms as President, ending his presidential career with a 65% approval rating, the highest end-of-term approval rating of any President since <PERSON>Dwight D. Eisenhower</PERSON>. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> also oversaw a boom of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy. Under <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.

The Whitewater controversy was an American political controversy that began with the real estate dealings of <PERSON>Bill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON> and their associates, <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> and <PERSON>Susan McDougal</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>Whitewater Development Corporation</ORGANIZATION>, a failed business venture in the 1970s and 1980s.

<PERSON>David Hale</PERSON>, the source of criminal allegations against President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> in the Whitewater affair, claimed in November 1993 that <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>, while governor of <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>, pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to <PERSON>Susan McDougal</PERSON>, the partner of the <ORGANIZATION>Clintons</ORGANIZATION> in the Whitewater land deal.

A <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> investigation did result in convictions against the <ORGANIZATION>McDougals</ORGANIZATION> for their role in the Whitewater project, but the <PERSON>Clintons</PERSON> themselves were never charged, and <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> maintains innocence in the affair.

In a separate case, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was ordered to pay $25,000 in fines to <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> state's bar officials and his <ORGANIZATION>Arkansas</ORGANIZATION> law license was suspended for five years. The agreement came on the condition that Whitewater prosecutors would not pursue federal perjury charges against him. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was suspended by the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> in October 2001, and, facing disbarment from that court, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> resigned from the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> bar in November.

Troopergate is the popular name of an alleged scandal involving allegations by two <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> state troopers that they arranged sexual liaisons for then-governor <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>. The allegations by state troopers <PERSON>Larry Patterson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Roger Perry</PERSON> were first reported by <PERSON>David Brock</PERSON> in the American Spectator in 1993. The story mentioned a woman named <PERSON>Paula</PERSON>, a reference to <PERSON>Paula Jones</PERSON>. The troopers were discovered to have been paid for their stories and <PERSON>Brock</PERSON> later admitted journalistic dishonesty and apologized.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001. Most of the controversy surrounded <PERSON>Marc Rich</PERSON> and allegations that <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON>Hugh Rodham</PERSON>, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons. Some of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s pardons remain a point of controversy.

The 1996 <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, prior to and during the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration and also involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> appointed the following justices to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION>:



<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s job approval rating ranged from 36% in mid-1993 to 64% in late-1993 and early-1994. In his second term, his rating was consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s. After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s rating reached its highest point at 73% approval. He finished with an approval rating of 68%, which was higher than that of any other departing president since polling began more than seventy years earlier.

As he was leaving office, a CNN/USA TODAY/Gallup poll revealed only 45% said they'd miss him. While 55% thought he "would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life", 68% thought he'd be remembered for his "involvement in personal scandal", and 58% answered "No" to the question "Do you generally think <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> is honest and trustworthy?". 47% of the respondents identified themselves as being <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> supporters. 47% said he would be remembered as either "outstanding" or "above average" as a president while 22% said he would be remembered as "below average" or "poor".

The <ORGANIZATION>Gallup Organization</ORGANIZATION> published a poll in February 2007 asking respondents to name the greatest president in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> history; <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> came in fourth place, capturing 13% of the vote. In a 2006 <ORGANIZATION>Quinnipiac University</ORGANIZATION> poll asking respondents to name the best president since World War II, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> ranked 3% behind <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> to place second with 25% of the vote. However, in the same poll, when respondents were asked to name the worst president since World War II, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> placed 1% behind <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> and 18% behind <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> to come in third with 16% of the vote.

In May 2006, a <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> poll comparing <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s job performance with that of his successor, <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON>, found that a strong majority of respondents said <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> outperformed <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in six different areas questioned. ABC News characterized public consensus on <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> as, "You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics and he's done a heck of a good job." <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s 65% Gallup Poll approval rating was also the highest Gallup approval rating of any President leaving office.



As the first <PERSON>Baby Boomer</PERSON> president, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was the first president in a half-century not to have been shaped by World War II. Authors <PERSON>Martin Walker</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bob Woodward</PERSON> state <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s innovative use of soundbite-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning was major for his high public approval ratings. When <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was sometimes described by religious conservatives as "the <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION> president."

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was very popular among African Americans and made improving race relations a major theme of his presidency. In 1998, Nobel Prize-winning author <PERSON>Toni Morrison</PERSON> called <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> "the first Black president," saying, "<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, <ORGANIZATION>McDonald's</ORGANIZATION>-and-junk-food-loving boy from <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION>," and comparing <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s sex life, scrutinized despite his career accomplishments, to the stereotyping and double standards that blacks typically endure. In 2008, after having endorsed the candidacy of <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON>, <PERSON>Morrison</PERSON> distanced herself from her 1998 remark about <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, saying that it was misunderstood. She noted that she has "no idea what his real instincts are, in terms of race" and claimed she was only describing the way he was being treated during the impeachment trial as an equivalent to a poor black person living in the ghetto.

Standing over 6'2" tall (1.88 m), <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was one of the tallest <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Presidents in the nation's history.

Throughout his career, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> has been subject to various allegations of sexual misconduct, though only his relationship with <PERSON>Lewinsky</PERSON> has been proven. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> categorically denies any inappropriate sexual conduct in all cases except the latter, though the <PERSON>Lewinsky</PERSON> affair and other allegations have become fodder for satirists, comedians, and parody in popular media.

For alleged misconduct during his governorship <PERSON>Paula Jones</PERSON> brought a sexual harassment lawsuit against <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> while he was president. However, <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> did not have any clear evidence to support her allegations. On April 2, 1998, <PERSON>Jones</PERSON>' lawsuit was dismissed. After which, <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> tried to file for an appeal In May of 1998, <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> refiled her lawsuit with the <ORGANIZATION>US Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> and alleged <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> both sexual harassed her and defamed her character. During the depositions for this lawsuit, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> denied having sexual relations with <PERSON>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON> a denial that became the basis for the impeachment charge of perjury. On November 18, 1998, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> agreed to an out-of-court settlement, and agreed to pay <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> and her attorneys a sum of $850,000.00. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, however, still offered no apology to <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> and still denied ever engaging in an a sexual affair with her.

In 1998, <PERSON>Kathleen Willey</PERSON> alleged <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> sexually assaulted her four years previously. In 1998, <PERSON>Juanita Broaddrick</PERSON> alleged she was raped by <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> some twenty years previously. The claims by <PERSON>Willey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Broaddrick</PERSON> were never brought before a court. The independent counsel determined <PERSON>Willey</PERSON> gave "false information" to the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> and inconsistent sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation. <PERSON>Broaddrick</PERSON>'s only sworn testimony about <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was a previous denial of any harassment by <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>. <PERSON>Gennifer Flowers</PERSON>, <PERSON>Elizabeth Ward Gracen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sally Perdue</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dolly Kyle Browning</PERSON> claimed to have had adulterous sexual relations with <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> during or before his service as governor. <PERSON>Garcen</PERSON>, however, later confessed that she lied and apologized for her actions.

<PERSON>Dolly Kyle Browning</PERSON> alleged that she and <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> engaged in a long sexual affair between the years of 1959 and 1992. In 1998, like <PERSON>Paula Jones</PERSON> had previously done, <PERSON>Browning</PERSON> sued <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> for sexual harassment, but her lawsuit was eventually dismissed. In April 2002, <PERSON>Browning</PERSON> tried to file for an appeal, but the <ORGANIZATION>US Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> would deny her appeal.

He said of President <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON>'s depiction of <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON>, "strength and wisdom are not opposing values." Despite <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s speech, the post-convention bounce to <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON>'s poll numbers was less than was hoped for.

Mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> has given dozens of paid speeches each year, earning $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.

To create the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> Foundation Climate Change Initiative (CCI), the <PERSON>William J. Clinton Foundation</PERSON> entered into a partnership with the <ORGANIZATION>Large Cities Climate Leadership Group</ORGANIZATION> on August 1, 2006, agreeing to provide resources to allow the participating cities to enter into an energy-saving product purchasing consortium and to provide technical and communications support.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> criticized the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration for its handling of emissions control while speaking at the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Climate Change Conference</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> on December 9, 2005. To promote initiatives concerning the environment, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> twice visited the <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> in 2006.

<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> had an episode of angina and was evaluated at <LOCATION>Northern Westchester Hospital</LOCATION> on September 2, 2004.

He was transferred to <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, where he underwent a successful quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery on September 6, 2004. The medical team stated, had he not had surgery, he would have likely suffered a massive heart attack within a few months. As a result of his open-heart surgery, he underwent a follow-up surgery to remove scar tissue and fluid from his left chest cavity on March 10, 2005. He has since recovered.

In the course of the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON>, leading some observers and party members to question the appropriateness of his role in view of his status as a former president. Some felt that <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was overshadowing his wife in the campaign, with her presidential rival <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> complaining that he sometimes "did not know which <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> he was running against." At a <ORGANIZATION>MSNBC</ORGANIZATION> debate, Republican primary candidate <PERSON>Mitt Romney</PERSON> said that he "can't imagine <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> left with nothing to do in the White House", suggesting that <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> would be a "co-president and try and help manage the economy and help manage the world affairs".

Top Democratic Party officials, including Rep. <PERSON>Rahm Emmanuel</PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee</ORGANIZATION> and a declared <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> supporter, asked <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> to tone down his attacks on <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> following the bitterly contested <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> caucus, suggesting that <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> could be damaging his own political capital and global stature. Some commentators even accused the former president of "playing the race card" against <PERSON>Obama</PERSON>, who is half-black, by suggesting he would understand if <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>'s African Americans naturally would vote for the black candidate, but rejected suggestions that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> was not ready for a black President. Many felt that by alienating black voters who had once overwhelmingly supported the <PERSON>Clintons</PERSON>, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> had tarnished his legacy as the so-called "first black president." In particular, Rep. <PERSON>James Clyburn</PERSON> (D-SC) suggested that <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s vocal attacks on <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> could damage the former President's legacy.Following his wife's disappointing defeat in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> again made headlines when he appeared to undermine and racialize <PERSON>Obama</PERSON>'s victory by comparing it to <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON>'s failed 1984 bid for the Presidency. Some observers suggested that the controversial comments fueled Sen. <PERSON>Ted Kennedy</PERSON>'s decision to endorse Sen. <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> for the Presidency. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> attracted further controversy with a series of attacks against <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> that many independents and former <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> supporters felt to be unfair. While some believed the attacks might eventually pay off, others felt they would damage <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON>'s presidential prospects and alienate <ORGANIZATION>Democratic</ORGANIZATION> voters in the general election. Former President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> defended his role in the <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON> presidential campaign, 2008 in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION>, disputing claims he made race a campaign issue. According to some reports, the accusations of racism hurt him personally, as blacks had long been <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s most loyal supporters.

During the primary campaign, his wife's aides criticized <PERSON>Clintons</PERSON> freelancing and deemed his office uncooperative at one point, they complained, his people would not allow one of her people to ride on his plane to campaign stops. His aides, on the other hand, stewed over what they saw as her peoples disregard for the advice of one of this generations great political minds and bristled at surrendering control of his schedule. On the night of the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> primary, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> grew playfully competitive with his wife over who had done more events or had had more impact. Governor <PERSON>Ed Rendell</PERSON> showed <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> the county-by-county returns, while she was superstitious and rarely watched election night coverage. According to <PERSON>Rendell</PERSON>, The president wanted to know exactly what the returns were in the places he had been and <PERSON>Hillary</PERSON> hadnt been. He kept showing <PERSON>Hillary</PERSON>, and she would laugh.

Due to <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s prominent role in his wife's presidential run and his criticism of <PERSON>Obama</PERSON>, many perceived an enduring distance between the two. <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was asked later if he thought presidential nominee <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> was qualified to be president. He replied that the Constitution sets qualifications. When pressed as to whether <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> was "ready" to be president, <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> replied, "You could argue that no one is ready to be president." Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of <PERSON>Obama</PERSON>'s election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008 when <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> enthusiastically endorsed <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> at the 2008 <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Convention</ORGANIZATION>, saying that all his experience as president assures him that <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> is "ready to lead".

<TITLE><PERSON>Elizabeth Garrett Anderson</PERSON></TITLE>

Dr. <PERSON>Elizabeth Garrett Anderson</PERSON>, LSA, MD (June 9 1836 - December 17 1917), was an English physician and feminist, the first woman to gain a medical qualification in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Garrett Anderson</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Aldeburgh</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Suffolk</LOCATION> in 1836, and the sister of <PERSON>Millicent Fawcett</PERSON>. She was also the cousin of <PERSON>Elizabeth Dunnell</PERSON> who married <PERSON>Richard Garrett III</PERSON> the famous owner of <ORGANIZATION>Richard Garrett & Sons</ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> was educated at home and at a private school. In 1860 she resolved to study medicine, an almost unheard-of thing for a woman at that time, and regarded by some as almost indecent. Having obtained some more or less irregular instruction at the <LOCATION>Middlesex Hospital</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, she was refused admission as a full student both there and at many other medical schools to which she applied. Finally she studied anatomy privately at the <LOCATION>London Hospital</LOCATION>, and with some of the professors at the <ORGANIZATION>University of St Andrews</ORGANIZATION>, and at the <LOCATION>Edinburgh</LOCATION> Extra-Mural school. She had no less difficulty in gaining a qualifying diploma to practise medicine. <ORGANIZATION>London University</ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Colleges of Physicians</ORGANIZATION> and Surgeons, and many other examining bodies refused to admit her to their examinations; but in the end the Society of Apothecaries allowed her to enter for the Licence of Apothecaries' Hall, which she obtained in 1865. This entitled her to have her name entered on the medical register, the second woman after <PERSON>Elizabeth Blackwell</PERSON>, and the first woman qualified in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to do so.

In 1866 she was appointed general medical attendant to <ORGANIZATION>St Mary</ORGANIZATION>'s Dispensary, a <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> institution started to enable poor women to obtain medical help from qualified practitioners of their own sex. The dispensary soon developed into the <LOCATION>New Hospital</LOCATION> for Women, and there Dr <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> worked for over twenty years. In 1870 she obtained the <ORGANIZATION>University of Paris</ORGANIZATION> degree of MD, three months after <PERSON>Frances Hoggan</PERSON> obtained that qualification. The same year she was elected to the first <ORGANIZATION>London School Board</ORGANIZATION>, at the head of the poll for <LOCATION>Marylebone</LOCATION>, and was also made one of the visiting physicians of the <LOCATION>East London Hospital</LOCATION> for Children; but the duties of these two positions she found to be incompatible with her principal work, and she soon resigned them. She also built a medical school for woman.

In 1871 she married <PERSON>James George Skelton Anderson</PERSON> (d. 1907) of the <ORGANIZATION>Orient Steamship Company</ORGANIZATION> co-owned by his uncle <PERSON>Arthur Anderson</PERSON>, but she did not give up her practice. She had three children, <PERSON>Louisa</PERSON>, <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> who died of meningitis, and <PERSON>Alan</PERSON>. <PERSON>Louisa</PERSON> also became a pioneering doctor of medicine and social campaigner. 

In 1873 she gained membership of the <ORGANIZATION>British Medical Association</ORGANIZATION> and remained the only woman member for 19 years, due to the Association's vote against the admission of further women "one of several instances where <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON>, uniquely, was able to enter a hitherto all male medical institution which subsequently moved formally to exclude any women who might seek to follow her."

<PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> worked steadily at the development of the <LOCATION>New Hospital</LOCATION> for Women, and (from 1874) at the creation of the <ORGANIZATION>London School of Medicine</ORGANIZATION> for Women. Both institutions have since been handsomely and suitably housed and equipped, the New hospital for Women (in the <LOCATION>Euston Road</LOCATION>) for many years being worked entirely by medical women, and the schools (in Hunter Street, WC1) having over 200 students, most of them preparing for the medical degree of <ORGANIZATION>London University</ORGANIZATION> (the present-day <ORGANIZATION>University College London</ORGANIZATION>), which was opened to women in 1877. In 1897 Dr <PERSON>Garrett Anderson</PERSON> was elected president of the East Anglian branch of the <ORGANIZATION>British Medical Association</ORGANIZATION>. 

On 9 November 1908 she was elected mayor of <LOCATION>Aldeburgh</LOCATION>, the first female mayor in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>. 

The movement for the admission of women to the medical profession, of which Dr <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> was the indefatigable pioneer in <LOCATION>England</LOCATION>, extended in her lifetime to all of <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, except for <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION>. She died in 1917 and is buried in <LOCATION>Aldeburgh</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Arthur Asher Miller</PERSON> (October 17, 1915 - February 10, 2005) was an American playwright and essayist. He was a prominent figure in American literature and cinema for over 61 years, writing a wide variety of plays, including celebrated plays such as The Crucible, A View from the Bridge, All My Sons, and Death of a Salesman, which are still studied and performed worldwide.Miller was often in the public eye, most famously for refusing to give evidence against others to the <ORGANIZATION>House Un-American Activities Committee</ORGANIZATION>, being the recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama among countless other awards, and for his marriage to <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON>. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> is considered by audiences and scholars as one of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>'s greatest playwrights, and his plays are lauded throughout the world.

<PERSON>Arthur Asher Miller</PERSON> was born to moderately affluent Jewish-American parents, <PERSON>Isidore</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Augusta Miller</ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>, in 1915. His father owned a women's clothes/coat-manufacturing business, which failed in the Wall Street Crash of 1929 after which his family moved to humbler quarters in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION>.

Because of the effects of the Great Depression on his family, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> had little money for college after graduating in 1932 from <ORGANIZATION>Abraham Lincoln High School</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>). Before securing a place at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION>, he worked in a number of menial jobs to pay for his tuition. He continued working in <PERSON>Ann Arbor</PERSON> to supplement his income.

At the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> first majored in journalism, where he became the reporter and night editor on the student paper, the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> Daily. It was during this time that he wrote his first work, No Villain. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> switched his major to English, and subsequently won the Avery Hopwood Award for No Villain. He was mentored by Professor <PERSON>Kenneth Rowe</PERSON>, who instructed him in his early forays into playwrighting. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> retained strong ties to his alma mater throughout the rest of his life, establishing the university's <ORGANIZATION>Arthur Miller Award</ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and <PERSON>Arthur Miller</PERSON> Award for Dramatic Writing in 1999, and lending his name to the <ORGANIZATION>Arthur Miller Theatre</ORGANIZATION> in 2000. In 1937, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> wrote Honors at Dawn, which also received the Avery Hopwood Award.

In 1938, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> received his bachelor's degree in English. After graduation, he joined the Federal Theater Project, a New Deal agency established to provide jobs in the theater. He chose the theater project although he had an offer to work as a scriptwriter for 20th Century Fox. However, <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> worried about possible Communist infiltration, closed the project. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> began working in the <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn Navy Yard</ORGANIZATION> while continuing to write radio plays, some of which were broadcast on CBS. 

On August 5, 1940, he married his college sweetheart, <PERSON>Mary Slattery</PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic</ORGANIZATION> daughter of an insurance salesman. The couple had two children, <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON>. <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> became a director, writer and producer who was, among other things, producer of the 1996 movie version of The Crucible. 

<PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was exempted from military service during World War II because of a high-school <LOCATION>american</LOCATION> football injury to his left kneecap.

Early career'''In 1944 <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> wrote The Man Who Had All the Luck, which was produced in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and won the Theater Guild's National Award.

In 1948 <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> built a small studio in <LOCATION>Roxbury</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>, a town that was to be his long time home. There, in less than a day, he wrote Act I of Death of a Salesman. Within six weeks, he completed the rest of the play, one of the works for which he is best known. Death of a Salesman premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949 at the Morosco Theatre, directed by <PERSON>Kazan</PERSON>, and starring <PERSON>Lee J. Cobb</PERSON> as <PERSON>Willy Loman</PERSON>, <PERSON>Mildred Dunnock</PERSON> as <PERSON>Linda</PERSON>, <PERSON>Arthur Kennedy</PERSON> as <PERSON>Biff</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Cameron Mitchell</PERSON> as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a Tony Award for best play, the <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> Drama Circle Critics Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards. The searing drama ran for 742 performances. 

In 1952, <PERSON>Elia Kazan</PERSON> appeared before the <ORGANIZATION>House Un-American Activities Committee</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>HUAC</ORGANIZATION>) and, under fear of being blacklisted from <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>, named eight black men from the Group Theatre who in recent years had been fellow members of the <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION>. After speaking with <PERSON>Kazan</PERSON> about his testimony <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION>Salem</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> to research the witch trials of 1692. The Crucible, an allegorical play in which <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> likened the situation with the <ORGANIZATION>House Un-American Activities Committee</ORGANIZATION> to the witch hunt in <LOCATION>Salem</LOCATION>, opened at the Beck Theatre on Broadway on January 22, 1953. Though widely considered only somewhat successful at the time of its initial release, today The Crucible is <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s most frequently produced work throughout the world. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kazan</PERSON> had been close friends throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, but after <PERSON>Kazan</PERSON>'s testimony to <ORGANIZATION>HUAC</ORGANIZATION>, the pair's friendship ended, and they did not speak to each other for the next ten years. <ORGANIZATION>HUAC</ORGANIZATION> took an interest in <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> himself not long after The Crucible opened, denying him a passport to attend the play's <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> opening in 1954. <PERSON>Kazan</PERSON> defended his own actions through his film On the Waterfront, in which a dockworker heroically testifies against a corrupt union boss. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was in turn to respond with the play A View from the Bridge, in which another dockworker's decision to inform on two illegal immigrants is based on ignoble, self-serving motives. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> did have his case overturned and his passport returned. His feelings about <ORGANIZATION>HUAC</ORGANIZATION> never changed.

<PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s experience with <ORGANIZATION>HUAC</ORGANIZATION> affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became very interested in the highly publicized <PERSON>Barbara Gibbons</PERSON> murder case, in which <PERSON>Gibbons</PERSON>' son <PERSON>Peter Reilly</PERSON> was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence. City Confidential, an A&E program about the murder, postulates that part of the reason <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> took such an active interest (including supporting <PERSON>Reilly</PERSON>'s defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to <PERSON>Reilly</PERSON>'s plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-in with the <ORGANIZATION>HUAC</ORGANIZATION>. He sympathized with <PERSON>Reilly</PERSON>, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the <ORGANIZATION>Connecticut State Police</ORGANIZATION> and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case. 

In 1955 a one-act version of <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s verse drama, A View From The Bridge, opened on Broadway in a joint bill with one of <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s lesser-known plays, A Memory of Two Mondays. The following year, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> returned to A View from the Bridge, revising it into a two-act prose version, which <PERSON>Peter Brook</PERSON> produced in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>.'''

In June 1956 <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> divorced <PERSON>Mary Slattery</PERSON>, and on June 29, he married <PERSON>Marilyn Monroe</PERSON>. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> and <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> had first met in 1951, when they had a brief affair, and had remained in contact since then. 

Taking advantage of the publicity of <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s marriage, <ORGANIZATION>HUAC</ORGANIZATION> subpoenaed him to appear before the committee shortly before the nuptials. Before appearing, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> asked the committee not to ask him to name names, to which the chairman agreed.When <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> attended the hearing, to which <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> accompanied him, risking her own career, he gave the committee a detailed account of his political activities. Reneging on the chairman's promise, the committee asked him to reveal to the names of friends and colleagues who had partaken in similar activities. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> refused to comply with the request, saying "I could not use the name of another person and bring trouble on him."As a result a judge found <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> guilty of contempt of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in May 1957. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was fined $500, sentenced to thirty days in prison, blacklisted, and disallowed a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> passport. In 1958 his conviction was overturned by the court of appeals, which ruled that <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> had been misled by the chairman of <ORGANIZATION>HUAC</ORGANIZATION>.

After his conviction was overturned, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> began work on The Misfits, which starred his wife. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said that the filming was one of the lowest points in his life, and shortly before the film's premiere in 1961, the pair divorced. Nineteen months later, <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> died of an apparent drug overdose.

<PERSON>Miller</PERSON> married photographer <PERSON>Inge Morath</PERSON> on February 17, 1962, and the first of their two children, <PERSON>Rebecca</PERSON>, was born that September. Their son <PERSON>Daniel</PERSON> was born with Down Syndrome in November, 1966, and was consequently institutionalized and excluded from the Millers' personal life at <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s insistence. The couple remained together until <PERSON>Inge</PERSON>'s death in 2002. <PERSON>Arthur Miller</PERSON>'s son-in-law, actor <PERSON>Daniel Day-Lewis</PERSON> is said to have visited <PERSON>Daniel</PERSON> frequently, and to have persuaded <PERSON>Arthur Miller</PERSON> to reunite with his adult son .

In 1964 <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s next play was produced. After the Fall is a deeply personal view of <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s own experiences during his marriage to <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON>. The play reunited <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> with his former friend <PERSON>Kazan</PERSON>: they collaborated on both the script and the direction. After the Fall opened on January 23, 1964 at the ANTA Theatre in <LOCATION>Washington Square Park</LOCATION> amid a flurry of publicity and outrage at putting a Monroe-like character, called <PERSON>Maggie</PERSON>, on stage. Also in the same year, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> produced Incident at Vichy.In 1965, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was elected the first American president of <ORGANIZATION>International PEN</ORGANIZATION>, a position which he held for four years. During this period <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> wrote the penetrating family drama, The Price, produced in 1968. It was <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s most successful play since Death of a Salesman.

In 1969, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s works were banned in the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> after he campaigned for the freedom of dissident writers. Throughout the 1970s, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> spent much of his time experimenting with the theatre, producing one-act plays such as Fame and The Reason Why, and traveling with his wife, producing In The Country and Chinese Encounters with her. Both his 1972 comedy The Creation of the World and Other Business and its musical adaptation, Up from Paradise, were critical and commercial failures.

In 1983, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> traveled to the People's Republic of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> to produce and direct Death of a Salesman at the People's Art Theatre in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>. The play was a success in <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and in 1984, Salesman in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, a book about <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s experience in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>, was published. Around the same time, Death of a Salesman was made into a TV movie starring <PERSON>Dustin Hoffman</PERSON> as <PERSON>Willy Loman</PERSON>. Shown on <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION>, it attracted 25 million viewers. In late 1987, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s autobiography, Timebends was published. Before his autobiography was published, it was well known that that <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> would not talk about <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> in interviews; in Timebends <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> talks about his experiences with <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> in detail.During the early 1990s <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> wrote three new plays, The Ride Down Mt. <PERSON>Morgan</PERSON> (1991), The Last Yankee (1992), and Broken Glass (1994). In 1996, a film of The Crucible starring <PERSON>Daniel Day Lewis</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Winona Ryder</ORGANIZATION> opened. <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> spent much of 1996 working on the screenplay to the film. Mr. <PERSON>Peters</PERSON>' Connections was staged off-Broadway in 1998, and Death of a Salesman was revived on Broadway in 1999 to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. The play, once again, was a large critical success, winning a Tony Award for best revival of a play. On May 1, 2002, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was awarded <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s Principe de Asturias Prize for Literature as "the undisputed master of modern drama." Previous winners include <PERSON>Doris Lessing</PERSON>, Gnter Grass and <PERSON>Carlos Fuentes</PERSON>. Later that year, <PERSON>Ingeborg Morath</PERSON> died of Lymphatic cancer at the age of 78. The following year <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> won the <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> Prize.In December 2004, the 89-year-old <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> announced that he has been living with a 34-year-old minimalist painter <PERSON>Agnes Barley</PERSON> at his Connecticut farm since 2002, and that they intended to marry. Within hours of her father's death, <PERSON>Rebecca Miller</PERSON> ordered Barley to vacate the premises, having consistently opposed the relationship.Miller's final play, Finishing the Picture, opened at the Goodman Theatre, <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION>, in the fall of 2004. He stated that the work was based on the experience of filming The Misfits. 

<PERSON>Miller</PERSON> died at his home in <LOCATION>Roxbury</LOCATION> of congestive heart failure on the evening of February 10, 2005 (the 56th anniversary of the Broadway debut of Death of a Salesman) at the age of 89, surrounded by his family.

<PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s career as a writer spanned over seven decades, and at the time of his death in 2005, <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> was considered to be one of the greatest dramatists of the twentieth century, among the likes of <PERSON>Harold Pinter</PERSON>, <PERSON>Eugene O'Neill</PERSON>, <PERSON>Luigi Pirandello</PERSON>, <PERSON>Samuel Beckett</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jean-Paul Sartre</PERSON>, <PERSON>Bertolt Brecht</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Tennessee Williams</PERSON>. After his death, many respected actors, directors, and producers paid tribute to <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>, some calling him the last great practitioner of the American stage, and Broadway theaters darkened their lights in a show of respect.Miller's alma mater, the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> opened the Arthur Miller Theatre in March, 2007. Per his express wish, it is the only theater in the world that bears <PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s name. 

<PERSON>Miller</PERSON>'s friend Professor <PERSON>Christopher Bigsby</PERSON> is currently working on <PERSON>Arthur Miller</PERSON>: The Definitive Biography, based on boxes of papers <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> made available to him before his death in 2005. The book will be published in November 2008, and is reported to reveal unpublished works in which <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> "bitterly attack[ed] the injustices of American racism long before it was taken up by the civil rights movement".













<TITLE><PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>William Henry</PERSON> "Bill" <PERSON>Gates III</PERSON>, KBE (born October 28, 1955), is an American business magnate, philanthropist, the world's third richest person (as of February 8, 2008), the second richest American (as of October 10, 2008), and chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>, the software company he founded with <PERSON>Paul Allen</PERSON>. During his career at <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> held the positions of CEO and chief software architect, and remains the largest individual shareholder with more than 8 percent of the common stock. He has also authored or co-authored several books.

Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. Although he is admired by many, a large number of industry insiders criticize his business tactics, which they consider anti-competitive, an opinion which has in some cases been upheld by the courts. In the later stages of his career, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the <ORGANIZATION>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, established in 2000.

<PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON> stepped down as chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> in January, 2000. He remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect. In June, 2006, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> to part-time work at <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> and full-time work at the <ORGANIZATION>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</ORGANIZATION>. He gradually transferred his duties to <PERSON>Ray Ozzie</PERSON>, chief software architect and <PERSON>Craig Mundie</PERSON>, chief research and strategy officer. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON>'s last full-time day at <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> was June 27, 2008. He remains at <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> as a part-time, non-executive chairman.

<PERSON>Gates</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>, to <PERSON>William H. Gates</PERSON>, Sr. and <PERSON>Mary Maxwell Gates</PERSON>. His family was upper middle class; his father was a prominent lawyer, his mother served on the board of directors for <ORGANIZATION>First Interstate BancSystem</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>United Way</LOCATION>, and her father, <PERSON>J. W. Maxwell</PERSON>, was a national bank president. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> has one older sister, <PERSON>Kristi</PERSON> (Kristianne), and one younger sister, <PERSON>Libby</PERSON>. He was the fourth of his name in his family, but was known as <PERSON>William Gates III</PERSON> or "Trey" because his father had dropped his own "III" suffix. Early on in his life, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON>'s parents had a law career in mind for him.

At thirteen he enrolled in the <ORGANIZATION>Lakeside School</ORGANIZATION>, an exclusive preparatory school. When he was in the eighth grade, the <ORGANIZATION>Mothers Club</ORGANIZATION> at the school used proceeds from <ORGANIZATION>Lakeside School</ORGANIZATION>'s rummage sale to buy an ASR-33 teletype terminal and a block of computer time on a <ORGANIZATION>General Electric</ORGANIZATION> (GE) computer for the school's students. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he commented on it and said, "There was just something neat about the machine." After the <ORGANIZATION>Mothers Club</ORGANIZATION> donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to <ORGANIZATION>Computer Center Corporation</ORGANIZATION> (CCC), which banned four Lakeside studentsGates, <PERSON>Paul Allen</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ric Weiland</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Kent Evansfor</PERSON> the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.

At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via teletype, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION>CCC</ORGANIZATION>'s offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in <LOCATION>FORTRAN</LOCATION>, LISP, and machine language. The arrangement with <ORGANIZATION>CCC</ORGANIZATION> continued until 1970, when it went out of business. The following year, <ORGANIZATION>Information Sciences Inc.</ORGANIZATION> hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with mostly female students. He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success." At age 17, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> formed a venture with <PERSON>Allen</PERSON>, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.

<PERSON>Gates</PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION>Lakeside School</ORGANIZATION> in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and subsequently enrolled at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard College</ORGANIZATION> in the fall of 1973. Prior to the mid 1990s, an SAT score of 1590 was equivalent to an IQ of about 170 (roughly the one in a million level), a figure that would frequently be cited by the press. While at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>, he met his future business partner, <PERSON>Steve Ballmer</PERSON>, whom he later appointed as CEO of <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>. He also met computer scientist <PERSON>Christos Papadimitriou</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION>, with whom he collaborated on a paper about algorithms. He did not have a definite study plan while a student at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. He remained in contact with <PERSON>Paul Allen</PERSON>, joining him at <ORGANIZATION>Honeywell</ORGANIZATION> during the summer of 1974. The following year saw the release of the MITS Altair 8800 based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company. He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> wanted to start a company.



After reading the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform. In reality, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge <ORGANIZATION>MITS</ORGANIZATION>'s interest. <ORGANIZATION>MITS</ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON>Ed Roberts</PERSON> agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at <ORGANIZATION>MITS</ORGANIZATION>'s offices in <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. <PERSON>Paul Allen</PERSON> was hired into MITS, and <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> took a leave of absence from <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> to work with <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> at MITS in <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION> in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-soft" and had their first office located in <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION>. Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "<ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>" was registered with the USPTO.

<ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>'s BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the <ORGANIZATION>MITS</ORGANIZATION> newsletter saying that MITS could not continue to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software without payment. This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems. The company moved from <LOCATION>Albuquerque</LOCATION> to its new home in <LOCATION>Bellevue</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> on January 1, 1979.

During <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>'s early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.

In 1980 <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> approached <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> to make the BASIC interpreter for its upcoming personal computer, the <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> PC. When <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> referred them to <ORGANIZATION>Digital Research</ORGANIZATION> (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.IBM's discussions with <ORGANIZATION>Digital Research</ORGANIZATION> went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON>Jack Sams</PERSON> mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later Gates proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that <PERSON>Tim Paterson</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Seattle Computer Products</ORGANIZATION> had made for hardware similar to the PC. <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> made a deal with <ORGANIZATION>SCP</ORGANIZATION> to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> delivered it to <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> as PC-DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> insisted that <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> let <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> keep the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION>'s system. They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> a major player in the industry.

<PERSON>Gates</PERSON> oversaw <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>'s company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and made Gates President of <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> and the Chairman of the Board. <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> launched its first retail version of <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> Windows on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with <ORGANIZATION>IBM</ORGANIZATION> to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences undermined the partnership. Gates distributed an internal memo on May 16, 1991 announcing that the OS/2 partnership was over and <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> would shift its efforts to the Windows NT kernel development.

From <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>'s founding in 1975 until 2006, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He aggressively broadened the company's range of products, and wherever <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> achieved a dominant position he vigorously defended it.

As an executive, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> met regularly with <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>'s senior managers and program managers. Firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative, berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.He often interrupted presentations with such comments as, "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" and, "Why don't you just give up your options and join the <ORGANIZATION>Peace Corps</ORGANIZATION>?" The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> was fully convinced. When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."

<PERSON>Gates</PERSON>'s role at <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> for most of its history was primarily a management and executive role. However, he was an active software developer in the early years, particularly on the company's programming language products. He has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100 line, but wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the company's products. On June 15, 2006, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors, placing <PERSON>Ray Ozzie</PERSON> in charge of day-to-day management and <PERSON>Craig Mundie</PERSON> in charge of long-term product strategy.

Many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>'s business practices have had Gates's approval. In the 1998 <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> v. <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> case, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner <PERSON>David Boies</PERSON> over the contextual meaning of words like "compete," "concerned," and "we." <ORGANIZATION>BusinessWeek</ORGANIZATION> reported:



<PERSON>Gates</PERSON> later said that he had simply resisted attempts by <PERSON>Boies</PERSON> to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with <PERSON>Boies</PERSON>? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to <PERSON>Boies</PERSON> in the first degree." Despite <PERSON>Gates</PERSON>'s denials, the judge ruled that <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> had committed monopolization and tying, blocking competition, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

The <ORGANIZATION>European Union Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> competition case is also a case brought by the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission of the European Union</ORGANIZATION> (<LOCATION>EU</LOCATION>) against <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> for abuse of its dominant position in the market (according to competition law). It started as a complaint from <ORGANIZATION>Novell</ORGANIZATION> over <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>'s licensing practices in 1993, and eventually resulted in the <LOCATION>EU</LOCATION> ordering <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> to divulge certain information about its server products and release a version of <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> Windows without Windows Media Player.

<PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON> decided in 2008 to appear in at least 1 commercial in a series of ads to promote <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>. This commercial, co-starring <PERSON>Jerry Seinfeld</PERSON>, is a 1 and a half minute talk between strangers as <PERSON>Seinfeld</PERSON> walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON> buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> shoes that are a size too big. Mr. <PERSON>Seinfeld</PERSON> begins to inform him about a pair of shoes called Conquistadors that run "a little tight" and sells him on them in a size 10 (whereas the store clerk was attempting an 11). As Mr. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> is buying the shoes he holds up his discount card, this card uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> in 1977 for a traffic violation . As they are walking out of the mall, <PERSON>Jerry Seinfeld</PERSON> asks <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON> if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a yes, he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a yes. Most critics are still in debate over the exact meaning of this commercial saying that it is too vague to make sense to them. Though some say that it is an homage to Mr. <PERSON>Seinfeld</PERSON>'s own show about "nothing"(Seinfeld). 

<PERSON>Gates</PERSON> married <PERSON>Melinda Gates</PERSON> (ne French) from <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> on January 1, 1994. They have three children: <PERSON>Jennifer Katharine</PERSON>(1996), <PERSON>Rory John</PERSON>(1999) and <PERSON>Phoebe Adele</PERSON>(2002).<PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON>' house is a 21st century earth-sheltered home in the side of a hill overlooking <LOCATION>Lake Washington</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Medina</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION>. According to King County public records, as of 2006, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125 million, and the annual property tax is $991,000. Also among <PERSON>Gates</PERSON>'s private acquisitions is the <ORGANIZATION>Codex Leicester</ORGANIZATION>, a collection of writings by <PERSON>Leonardo da Vinci</PERSON>, which <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> bought for $30.8 million at an auction in 1994. Gates is also known as an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby. He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.

<PERSON>Gates</PERSON> was number one on the "Forbes 400" list from 1993 through to 2007 and number one on Forbes list of "The World's Richest People" from 1995 to 2007. In 1999, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON>'s wealth briefly surpassed $101 billion, causing the media to call him a "centibillionaire". Since 2000, the nominal value of his <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> holdings has declined due to a fall in <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>'s stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multi-billion dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> has several investments outside <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION>, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667, and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667. He founded <ORGANIZATION>Corbis</ORGANIZATION>, a digital imaging company, in 1989. In 2004 he became a director of <ORGANIZATION>Berkshire Hathaway</ORGANIZATION>, the investment company headed by long-time friend <PERSON>Warren Buffett</PERSON>. 

Gates began to realize the expectations others had of him when public opinion mounted that he could give more of his wealth to charity. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> studied the work of <PERSON>Andrew Carnegie</PERSON> and <PERSON>John D. Rockefeller</PERSON> and in 1994 sold some of his <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> stock to create the <PERSON>William H. Gates Foundation</PERSON>. In 2000, <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> and his wife combined three family foundations into one to create the charitable <ORGANIZATION>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</ORGANIZATION>, which is the largest transparently operated charitable foundation in the world. The foundation is setup to allow benefactors access how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION>Wellcome Trust</ORGANIZATION>. The generosity and extensive philanthropy of <PERSON>David Rockefeller</PERSON> has been credited as a major influence. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> and his father have met with <ORGANIZATION>Rockefeller</ORGANIZATION> several times and have modeled their giving in part on the <PERSON>Rockefeller</PERSON> family's philanthropic focus, namely those global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations. As of 2007 <PERSON>Bill</PERSON> and <PERSON>Melinda Gates</PERSON> were the second most generous philanthropist in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, having given over $28 billion to charity.

The foundation has also received criticism because it invests the assets that it has not yet distributed, with the exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment. As a result, its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the Foundation is attempting to relieve poverty. These include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world.In response to press criticism, the foundation announced in 2007 a review of its investments to assess social responsibility. It subsequently cancelled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.

Time magazine named Gates one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th century, as well as one of the 100 most influential people of 2004, 2005, and 2006. Time also collectively named <PERSON>Gates</PERSON>, his wife <PERSON>Melinda</PERSON> and alternative rock band U2's lead singer <PERSON>Bono</PERSON> as the 2005 Persons of the Year for their humanitarian efforts. In 2006, he was voted eighth in the list of "Heroes of our time". <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> was listed in the Sunday Times power list in 1999, named CEO of the year by Chief Executive Officers magazine in 1994, ranked number one in the "Top 50 Cyber Elite" by Time in 1998, ranked number two in the Upside Elite 100 in 1999 and was included in The Guardian as one of the "Top 100 influential people in media" in 2001.

Gates has received honorary doctorates from <ORGANIZATION>Nyenrode Business Universiteit</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Breukelen</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>The Netherlands</LOCATION> in 2000, the <ORGANIZATION>Royal Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> in 2002, <ORGANIZATION>Waseda University</ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> in 2005, <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> in June 2007, and from <LOCATION>Karolinska Institutet</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Stockholm</LOCATION>, in January 2008. <PERSON>Gates</PERSON> was also made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) from Queen <PERSON>Elizabeth II</PERSON> in 2005, in addition to having entomologists name the <PERSON>Bill Gates</PERSON> flower fly, <PERSON>Eristalis</PERSON> gatesi, in his honor.

In November 2006, he and his wife were awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION>, and specifically in the program "Un pas de lectores".

Gates has authored two books:













<TITLE><PERSON>Arnold Schwarzenegger</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger</PERSON> (German ; born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian-American bodybuilder, actor, businessman, and politician, currently serving as the 38th Governor of the state of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film icon. He was nicknamed "The Austrian Oak" and "The Styrian Oak" in his bodybuilding days, "Arnold Strong" and "Arnie" during his acting career, and more recently "The Governator" (a portmanteau of Governor and The Terminator, one of his film roles).

As a Republican, he was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall election to replace then-Governor <PERSON>Gray Davis</PERSON>. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was sworn in on November 17, 2003, to serve the remainder of <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>'s term. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was then re-elected on November 7, 2006, in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>'s 2006 gubernatorial election, to serve a full term as governor, defeating Democrat <PERSON>Phil Angelides</PERSON>, who was <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> State Treasurer at the time. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was sworn in for a second term on January 5, 2007. In May 2004 and 2007, he was named as one of the Time 100 people who help shape the world.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> is married to <PERSON>Maria Shriver</PERSON> and has four children.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Thal</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> (German: <PERSON>Thal</PERSON> bei <LOCATION>Graz</LOCATION>), a small village bordering the Styrian capital <LOCATION>Graz</LOCATION>, and was christened <PERSON>Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger</PERSON>. His parents were the local police chief <PERSON>Gustav Schwarzenegger</PERSON> (1907 1972), and his wife, <PERSON>Aurelia Jadrny</PERSON> (1922 1998). They were married on October 20, 1945 <PERSON>Gustav</PERSON> was 38, and <PERSON>Aurelia</PERSON> was a 23-year-old widow with a son named <PERSON>Meinhard</PERSON>. According to <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>, both of his parents were very strict: "Back then in <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> it was a very different world, if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared." He grew up in a Roman Catholic family who attended church service every Sunday.

<PERSON>Gustav</PERSON> had a preference for <PERSON>Meinhard</PERSON>, the elder of the two sons. His favoritism was "strong and blatant," which stemmed from unfounded suspicion "that <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> wasnt his child." <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has said his father had "no patience for listening or understanding your problems there was a wall; a real wall." <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> had a good relationship with his mother, and kept in touch with her until her death. In later life, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> commissioned the <PERSON>Simon Wiesenthal Centre</PERSON> to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of atrocities. At school, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was apparently in the middle, but stood out for his "cheerful, good-humored and exuberant" character. Money was a problem in the household; <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.

As a boy, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> played many sports--heavily influenced by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his football coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> chose bodybuilding over football (soccer) as a career. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has responded to a question asking if he was age 13 when he started weightlifting: "I actually started weight training when I was fifteen, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting." However, his official website biography claims: "At 14, he started an intensive training program with <PERSON>Kurt Marnul</PERSON>, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career." During a speech in 2001, he said, "My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school." <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> took to visiting a gym in <LOCATION>Graz</LOCATION>, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, <PERSON>Steve Reeves</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Johnny Weissmuller</PERSON> on the big screen. "I was inspired by individuals like <PERSON>Reg Park</PERSON> and <PERSON>Steve Reeves</PERSON>." When <PERSON>Reeves</PERSON> passed away in 2000, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> fondly remembered him: "As a teenager, I grew up with <PERSON>Steve Reeves</PERSON>. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams ... <PERSON>Steve Reeves</PERSON> has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." In 1961, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> met former Mr. <PERSON>Austria Kurt Marnul</PERSON>, who invited him to train at the gym in <LOCATION>Graz</LOCATION>. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he was known to break into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. "It would make me sick to miss a workout I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it." When <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied, "I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a <PERSON>John Wayne</PERSON> movie."

In 1971, his brother <PERSON>Meinhard</PERSON> died in a car accident. <PERSON>Meinhard</PERSON> had been drinking and was killed instantly, and <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> did not attend his funeral. <PERSON>Meinhard</PERSON> was due to marry <PERSON>Erika Knapp</PERSON>, and the couple shared a three-year-old son <PERSON>Patrick</PERSON>. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> would pay for <PERSON>Patrick</PERSON>'s education and a life in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Gustav</PERSON> died the following year from a stroke. In Pumping Iron, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer both stated that this story was taken from another bodybuilder for the purpose of showing the extremes that some would go to for their sport, and to make <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s image more cold and machine-like to fan controversy for the film. <PERSON>Barbara Baker</PERSON>, his first serious girlfriend, has said he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother. Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he did not attend his father's funeral.

In an interview with Fortune magazine in 2004, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> told how he suffered what "would now be called child abuse" at the hands of his father. "My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'you can't do this,' I said, 'this is not going to be for much longer, because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.' "

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> served in the Austrian army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males. He won the Junior Mr. <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> contest in 1965. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> went AWOL during basic training so that he could take part in the competition and spent a week in an army jail: "Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences. When I got to <LOCATION>Stuttgart</LOCATION>, I was all confused. I forgot my posing routine, I had to borrow posing trunks, but still I won!" Contrary to popular belief, it was not <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s bodybuilding debut, which had occurred two years earlier at a minor contest in <LOCATION>Graz</LOCATION>, at Steirer Hof Hotel (where he had placed second). He was voted best built man of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>, which made him famous.

"The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich." <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner <PERSON>Chester Yorton</PERSON>.

<PERSON>Charles</PERSON> "Wag" <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON>, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> and offered to coach him. As <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> had little money, <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON> invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate. <PERSON>Yorton</PERSON>'s leg definition had been judged superior, and <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>, under a training program devised by <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON>, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> helped <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. The training paid off and in 1967 <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> won the title for the first time in 1967, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20. He would go on to win the title a further four times. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> then flew back to <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION>, training for four to six hours daily, attending business school and working in a health club (<PERSON>Rolf Putzinger</PERSON>'s gym where he worked and trained from 1966-1968), returning in 1968 to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> to win his next Mr. Universe title. He frequently told <PERSON>Roger C. Field</PERSON>, a friend in <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION> at that time "I'm going to become the greatest actor!"

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> moved to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in September 1968 at the age of 21, speaking little English. "Naturally, when I came to this country, my accent was very bad, and my accent was also very strong, which was an obstacle as I began to pursue acting." There he trained at Gold's Gym in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, under <PERSON>Joe Weider</PERSON>. From 1970 to 1974, one of <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s weight training partners was <PERSON>Ric Drasin</PERSON>, a professional wrestler who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> also became good friends with professional wrestler "Superstar" <PERSON>Billy Graham</PERSON>. In 1970, at age 23, he captured his first Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON> title in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, and would go on to win the title a total of seven times.

In 1969, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> met <PERSON>Barbara Outland Baker</PERSON>, an English teacher he lived with until 1974. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> talked about <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> in his memoir in 1977: "Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life." <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> has described <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> as "a joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic" but claims towards the end of the relationship he became "insufferable classically conceited the world revolved around him." <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> published her memoir in 2006, entitled <ORGANIZATION>Arnold</ORGANIZATION> and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak. Although Baker, at times, paints an unflattering portrait of her former lover <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> for three hours. <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. They shared an apartment in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard. Although <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> claims that when she first met him, he had "little understanding of polite society" and she found him a turn-off, she says, "He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> loved me."

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> met his next love, <PERSON>Sue Moray</PERSON>, a <LOCATION>Beverly Hills</LOCATION> hairdresser's assistant, on <LOCATION>Venice Beach</LOCATION> in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: "We were faithful when we were both in <LOCATION>LA.</LOCATION>..but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted." <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> met <PERSON>Maria Shriver</PERSON> at the <PERSON>Robert F. Kennedy</PERSON> Tennis Tournament in August 1977, and went on to have a relationship with both women until August 1978, when <PERSON>Moray</PERSON> (who knew of his relationship with <PERSON>Shriver</PERSON>) issued an ultimatum.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has said his big dream from the age of 10 was to move to the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION>. He questioned what he was doing "on the farm" in <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>, and believed bodybuilding was his "ticket to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>": "Im sure I can go to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> if I win Mr. Universe." LA Weekly said in 2002 that <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> is the most famous immigrant in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>, who "overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s."



<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has remained a prominent face in the bodybuilding sport long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows. For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected Governor, he was appointed executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. The magazine <ORGANIZATION>MuscleMag International</ORGANIZATION> has a monthly two-page article on him, and refers to him as "The King."

One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> contest in 1965. He won Mr. <PERSON>Europe</PERSON> the following year, at age 19. He would go on to compete in and win many bodybuilding contests, as well as some powerlifting contests, including five Mr. Universe (4 <ORGANIZATION>NABBA</ORGANIZATION> [<LOCATION>England</LOCATION>], 1 <ORGANIZATION>IFBB</ORGANIZATION> [<LOCATION>USA</LOCATION>]) wins, and seven Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON> wins, a record which would stand until <PERSON>Lee Haney</PERSON> won his eighth consecutive Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON> title in 1991.

In 1967, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> competed in and won the <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION> stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg/560 lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two foot rests. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has said the following on his size: "During the peak of my career, my calves were 20 inches, thighs 28.5 inches, waist 34 inches, chest 57 inches, and 22-inch arms."

In a full squat (buttocks close to ground) <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> had a personal record of 181 kg/400lbs, for twelve repetitions.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON>. His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion <PERSON>Sergio Oliva</PERSON>. However, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> came back in 1970 and won the competition making him the youngest ever Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON> at the age of 23, a record he holds to this day.

He continued his winning streak in the 1971 1974 competitions. In 1975, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time, beating <PERSON>Franco Columbu</PERSON>. After the 1975 Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON> contest, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.

Months before the 1975 Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON> contest, filmmakers <PERSON>George Butler</PERSON> and <PERSON>Robert Fiore</PERSON> persuaded <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called Pumping Iron. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film Stay Hungry with <PERSON>Jeff Bridges</PERSON>. <PERSON>Lou Ferrigno</PERSON> proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> convincingly won the 1975 Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON>. After being declared Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON> for a sixth consecutive time, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> retired from competition.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON>. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was training for his role in <PERSON>Conan</PERSON>, and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding, and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON> contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret, in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> had been hired to provide color commentary for network television, when he announced at the eleventh hour that while he was there: "Why not compete?" <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. After being declared Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON> for a seventh time, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> officially retired from competition.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has admitted to using performance-enhancing anabolic steroids while they were legal, writing in 1967 that "steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up." He has called the drugs "tissue building."

In 1999, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> sued Dr. <PERSON>Willi Heepe</PERSON>, a German doctor who publicly predicted an early death for the bodybuilder, based on a link between steroid use and later heart problems. Because the doctor had never examined him personally, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> collected a DM20,000 ($12,000 USD) libel judgment against him in a German court. In 1999, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> also sued and settled with <ORGANIZATION>The Globe</ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health. As late as 1996, a year before open heart surgery to replace an aortic valve with a human homograft valve, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> publicly defended his use of anabolic steroids during his bodybuilding career.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was born with a bicuspid aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets). Both his father and his brother had the same condition.





<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of <LOCATION>Hercules</LOCATION> in 1970's Hercules in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>. Credited under the name "<PERSON>Arnold Strong</PERSON>," his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf and mute hit-man for the mob in director <PERSON>Robert Altman</PERSON>'s The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career. "It was very difficult for me in the beginning I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird,' that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance."

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> drew attention and boosted his profile in the bodybuilding film Pumping Iron (1977), elements of which were dramatized. In 1991, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> auditioned for the title role of The Incredible Hulk, but did not win the role due to his height. Later, <PERSON>Lou Ferrigno</PERSON> got the part of Dr. <PERSON>David Banner</PERSON>'s alter ego. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> appeared with <PERSON>Kirk Douglas</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ann-Margret</PERSON> in the 1979 comedy The Villain.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s breakthrough film was the mythical epic <PERSON>Conan</PERSON> the Barbarian in 1982, which was a box-office hit. This was followed by a sequel, <PERSON>Conan</PERSON> the Destroyer in 1984, although its performance was disappointing. In 1983, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> starred in the promotional video "Carnival in Rio".



In 1984, he made the first of three appearances as the titular character in director <PERSON>James Cameron</PERSON>'s science-fiction film The Terminator. Following The Terminator, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> made <ORGANIZATION>Red Sonja</ORGANIZATION> in 1985, which "sank without a trace."

During the 1980s, audiences had a large appetite for action films, with both <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sylvester Stallone</PERSON> becoming international stars. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s roles reflected his droll, often self-deprecating sense of humor (including sometimes famously bad puns), separating his roles from more serious action hero fare. His alternative-universe comedy/thriller Last Action Hero featured a poster of the movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day which, in the fictional alternate universe, had <PERSON>Sylvester Stallone</PERSON> as its star.

Following his arrival as a Hollywood superstar, he made a number of successful films: Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), The Running Man (1987), and Red Heat (1988). In Predator (1987), another successful film, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> led a cast which included future <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> Governor <PERSON>Jesse Ventura</PERSON> (Ventura also appeared in The Running Man and Batman & <PERSON>Robin</PERSON> with <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>) and future <ORGANIZATION>Kentucky Gubernatorial</ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON>Sonny Landham</PERSON>.

Twins (1988), a comedy with <PERSON>Danny DeVito</PERSON>, was a change of pace, and also proved successful. Total Recall (1990) netted <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> $10 million and 15% of the gross, and was a widely praised, science-fiction script directed by <PERSON>Paul Verhoeven</PERSON>, based on the <PERSON>Philip K. Dick</PERSON> short story, "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale". Kindergarten Cop (1990) reunited him with director <PERSON>Ivan Reitman</PERSON>, who directed him in Twins.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt, entitled "The Switch," and then with the 1992 telemovie Christmas in <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION>. He has not directed since.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s commercial high-water mark was the 1991 sequel to his 1984 hit The Terminator: , which was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. In 1993, the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Theatre Owners</ORGANIZATION> named him the "International Star of the Decade." His next film project, the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof Last Action Hero was released opposite Jurassic Park, with the box office suffering accordingly. His next film, the action comedy True Lies (1994) was a highly popular send-up of spy films, and saw <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>, reunited with The Terminator director <PERSON>James Cameron</PERSON>, appearing opposite <PERSON>Jamie Lee Curtis</PERSON>.

Shortly thereafter came the comedy Junior (1994), directed by <ORGANIZATION>Twins</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Ivan Reitman</PERSON> and again playing opposite co-star <PERSON>Danny DeVito</PERSON>. This film brought <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for Best Actor Musical or Comedy. It was followed by the action thriller Eraser (1996), and the comic book-based <ORGANIZATION>Batman & Robin</ORGANIZATION> (1997), where he played the villain Mr. <PERSON>Freeze</PERSON>. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the failure of <ORGANIZATION>Batman & Robin</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s film career and box office prominence went into decline.

Several film projects were announced with <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> attached to star, including the remake of Planet of the Apes, a new film version of I Am Legend, and a World War II film scripted by <PERSON>Quentin Tarantino</PERSON> that would have seen <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> play an Austrian.

Instead, he returned after a hiatus with the supernatural thriller ''End of Days'' (1999), later followed by the action films The 6th Day (2000) and Collateral Damage (2002). In 2003, he reprised his role in , which went on to earn over $150 million domestically.



In tribute to <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter (82-foot) tall Terminator statue in a park in central <LOCATION>Graz</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the Special Olympics.

His latest film appearances included a 3-second cameo appearance in The Rundown (AKA, Welcome to the Jungle) with The Rock, and the 2004 remake of Around the World in 80 Days, where he appeared onscreen with action star <PERSON>Jackie Chan</PERSON> for the first time.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> voiced <PERSON>Baron von Steuben</PERSON> in Episode 24 ("Valley Forge") of Liberty's Kids.



<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has been a registered Republican for many years. As an actor, his political views were always well-known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a liberal and Democratic-leaning community. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> gave a speech and explained why he was a Republican:



In 1985, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> appeared in Stop the Madness, an anti-drug music video sponsored by the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the 1988 Presidential election, accompanying then-Vice President <PERSON>George H.W. Bush</PERSON> at a campaign rally.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s first political appointment was as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993. He was nominated by <PERSON>George H. W. Bush</PERSON>, who dubbed him "Conan the Republican". He later served as Chairman for the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Governor's <ORGANIZATION>Council on Physical Fitness</ORGANIZATION> and Sports under Governor <PERSON>Pete Wilson</PERSON>. Yet, political analysts have identified <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> as a liberal, as he has become more left-leaning since his election.

Between 1993 and 1994, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> ambassador (a mostly ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television/radio public service announcements to give blood. A small amount of interest was garnered by his wearing of a white t-shirt with the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> on it, while posing with a flexed arm; the image made it into several celebrity magazines.

In an interview with Talk magazine in late 1999, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, "I think about it many times. The possibility is there, because I feel it inside." The Hollywood Reporter claimed shortly after that <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> sought to end speculation that he might run for governor of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. Following his initial comments, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> said, "I'm in show business I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?"

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> announced his candidacy in the 2003 <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> recall election for Governor of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> on the August 6, 2003 episode of The Tonight Show with <PERSON>Jay Leno</PERSON>. As a candidate in the recall election, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the "Governator" (referring to The Terminator movies, see above) and "The Running Man" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election "Total Recall" (yet another Schwarzenegger starrer). <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.

On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor <PERSON>Gray Davis</PERSON> being removed from office with 55.4% of the Yes vote in favor of a recall. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was elected Governor of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to <PERSON>Davis</PERSON>. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> defeated Democrat <PERSON>Cruz Bustamante</PERSON>, fellow Republican <PERSON>Tom McClintock</PERSON>, and others. His nearest rival, <PERSON>Bustamante</PERSON>, received less than 30% of the vote. In total, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> won the election by about 1.3 million votes. Under the regulations of the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Constitution, no runoff election was required. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was the first foreign-born governor of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> since Ireland-born Governor <PERSON>John G. Downey</PERSON> in 1862.

As soon as <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was elected governor, <PERSON>Willie Brown</PERSON> said he would start a drive to recall the governor. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was equally entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up gridlock. Building on a catchphrase from a sketch partly parodying his bodybuilding career, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic State</ORGANIZATION> politicians "girlie men," (a reference from a Saturday Night Live sketch called "<PERSON>Hans</PERSON> and Franz").



<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> enjoyed a large degree of success and victories in his early governorship, including repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses being given out to illegal immigrants, but later began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a special election he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. He would later comment that "no one could win if the opposition raised 160 million dollars to defeat you."

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> then went against the advice of fellow <ORGANIZATION>Republican</ORGANIZATION> strategists and appointed a Democrat, <PERSON>Susan Kennedy</PERSON>, as his Chief of Staff. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.

He has appeared alongside his fellow actor from Around the World in 80 Days, <PERSON>Jackie Chan</PERSON>, in a government advertisement to combat copyright infringement.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> ran for re-election against Democrat <PERSON>Phil Angelides</PERSON>, the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> State Treasurer, in the 2006 elections, held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for <PERSON>Angelides</PERSON>, a margin of well over one million votes. The election further enhanced his political credentials.

It is rumored that <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> might run for the <ORGANIZATION>United States Senate</ORGANIZATION> in 2010 (he will be term-limited then), if incumbent Senator <PERSON>Barbara Boxer</PERSON> retires.

<PERSON>Wendy Leigh</PERSON>, who wrote an unofficial biography on <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as building blocks to escape a depressing home. <PERSON>Leigh</PERSON> portrays <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, "I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential I was always fascinated by people in control of other people." <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, "I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and <PERSON>Eunice</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sargent Shriver</PERSON> became my heroes." <PERSON>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</PERSON> was sister of <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON>, and mother-in-law to <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sargent Shriver</PERSON> is husband to <PERSON>Eunice</PERSON> and father-in-law to <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>. According to the 2005 Year-in-Review issue of Time magazine, supporters of <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> are hoping to amend the Constitution so that he can run for President of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>. Indeed, in The Simpsons Movie, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> is portrayed as the President and in the <PERSON>Sylvester Stallone</PERSON> movie Demolition Man, it is revealed there was an amendment to the constitution that allowed him to become President.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> is a dual Austria/United States citizen. He holds Austrian citizenship by birth and has held <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizenship since becoming naturalized in 1983. Being Austrian and thus European he was able to win the 2007 <ORGANIZATION>European Voice</ORGANIZATION> campaigner of the year award for taking action against climate change with the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme with other <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> states and possibly with the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> does not accept his governor's salary of $175,000 per year, and instead donates it to charities.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s endorsement in the Republican primary of the 2008 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Presidential election was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates <PERSON>Rudy Giuliani</PERSON> and Senator <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON>, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. <PERSON>Giuliani</PERSON> dropped out of the Presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>, and endorsed <PERSON>McCain</PERSON>. Later that night, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was in the audience at a Republican debate at the <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> Presidential Library in <LOCATION>Simi Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>. The following day, he endorsed <PERSON>McCain</PERSON>, joking, "It's <PERSON>Rudy</PERSON>'s fault!" (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator <PERSON>McCain</PERSON>'s campaign; both spoke about their environmental concerns and concerns for the economy.

Governor <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> played a significant role in opposing Proposition 66, a proposed amendment of the Californian Three Strikes Law, in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent and/or serious in order to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot, governor <PERSON>Arnold Schwarzenegger</PERSON> launched an intensive campaign against Proposition 66. He stated that "it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists".





On September 27, 2006 <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> signed a bill creating the nations first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the states greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce Californias emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> signed another executive order on October 17, 2006 allowing <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to work with the <ORGANIZATION>Northeasts Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</ORGANIZATION>. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the amount of carbon credits they have will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan is set to be in effect in 2009.In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has adapted one of his Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.

In 1977, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s autobiography/weight-training guide Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder was published and became a huge success. After taking English classes at <ORGANIZATION>Santa Monica College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>, he earned a B.A., from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Wisconsin-Superior</ORGANIZATION>, where he graduated Business and <ORGANIZATION>International Economics</ORGANIZATION>, in 1979.

On April 26, 1986, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> married television journalist <PERSON>Maria Shriver</PERSON>, niece of the past President of the <LOCATION>United States John F. Kennedy</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Hyannis</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON>John Baptist Riordan</PERSON> performed the ceremony at <ORGANIZATION>St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>. They have four children: <PERSON>Katherine Eunice Shriver Schwarzenegger</PERSON> (born December 13, 1989 in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>); <PERSON>Christina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger</PERSON> (born July 23, 1991 in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>); <PERSON>Patrick Arnold Schwarzenegger</PERSON> (born September 18, 1993 in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>); and <PERSON>Christopher Sargent Shriver Schwarzenegger</PERSON> (born September 27, 1997 in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>California</LOCATION>)

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> and his family currently live in their 11,000-square-foot (1 022 m) home in <LOCATION>Brentwood</LOCATION>. They used to own a home in the <LOCATION>Pacific Palisades</LOCATION>. The family owns vacation homes in <LOCATION>Sun Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Hyannis Port</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> does not have a home in <LOCATION>Sacramento</LOCATION>. However, whenever he is in the state capitol, he lives in the Hyatt Regency hotel suite. The suite costs about $65,000 a year.

On Sundays, the family attends Mass at <ORGANIZATION>St. Monica</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION>.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has said he believes the secret of a good marriage is love and respect. "If you have the ultimate love for your wife and she has it for you, I think you have a great head start That's not to say it won't be difficult sometimes. You go through your ups and downs but you work through it." <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has talked about parenthood in 2000: "One of the best things you can do with your children is play with them. At the same time, I act very silly. Many times I do a lot of sports with them. I play games with them. Act out parts. We do little plays, sometimes."

His official height of 6'2" (188 cm) has been brought into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was measured to be 6'1.5", a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders. In 1988 both the <ORGANIZATION>Daily Mail</ORGANIZATION> and Time Out magazine mentioned that <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> appeared noticeably shorter than this publicised figure. More recently, before running for Governor, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s height was once again questioned in an article by the <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> Reader. As Governor, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> engaged in a light-hearted exchange with <ORGANIZATION>Assemblyman Herb Wesson</ORGANIZATION> over their heights. At one point <PERSON>Wesson</PERSON> made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, "settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is." by using a tailor's tape measure on the Governor. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> later retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words "Need a lift?" on the five-foot-five (165 cm) Wessons chair before a negotiating session in his office. The debate on <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s height has spawned a website solely dedicated to it, and his page remains one of the most active on CelebHeights.com, a website which discusses the heights of celebrities.

In 2005, <PERSON>Peter Pilz</PERSON>, from the Austrian <ORGANIZATION>Green Party</ORGANIZATION>, demanded that parliament revoke <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s Austrian citizenship. This demand was based on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act that states: A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic. <PERSON>Pilz</PERSON> claimed that <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> under Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights) had indeed done damage to <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION>'s reputation. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> explained his actions by referring to the fact that his only duty as Governor of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> was to prevent an error in the judicial system.

In honor of its most famous son, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s home town of <LOCATION>Graz</LOCATION> had its soccer stadium named The Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium. It is the home of both <PERSON>Grazer</PERSON> AK and <PERSON>Sturm Graz</PERSON>. Following the <ORGANIZATION>Stanley Williams</ORGANIZATION> execution and after street protests in his hometown, several local politicians began a campaign to remove <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s name from the stadium. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> responded, saying that "to spare the responsible politicians of the city of <LOCATION>Graz</LOCATION> further concern, I withdraw from them as of this day the right to use my name in association with the <LOCATION>Liebenau Stadium</LOCATION>," and set a tight deadline of just a couple of days to remove his name. <LOCATION>Graz</LOCATION> officials removed <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s name from the stadium in December 2005. It is now officially titled UPC-Arena.

The <LOCATION>Sun Valley Resort</LOCATION> has a short ski trail called <ORGANIZATION>Arnold</ORGANIZATION>'s Run, named after <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> (It was named after him in 2001). The trail is categorized as a black diamond, or most difficult, for its terrain.

He bought the first Hummer manufactured for civilian use in 1992, a model so large, 6,300 lb (2900 kg) and 7 feet (2.1 m) wide, that it is classified as a large truck and <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> fuel economy regulations do not apply to it. During the Gubernatorial Recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about US$21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the <ORGANIZATION>California Hydrogen Highway Network</ORGANIZATION>, and gained a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Energy</ORGANIZATION> grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.

People in <PERSON>Thal</PERSON> bei <LOCATION>Graz</LOCATION> celebrated <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s 60th birthday by throwing a party. Officials proclaimed A Day for <ORGANIZATION>Arnold</ORGANIZATION> on July 30, 2007. <PERSON>Thal</PERSON> 145, the number of the house where <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was born, belonged to <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> and nobody will ever be assigned to that number.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> broke his right femur while skiing in <LOCATION>Sun Valley</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> with his family on December 23, 2006. He tripped over his ski pole on Lower Warm Springs run on Bald Mountain, an 'easy' or green level run. He is an expert level skier. On December 26, 2006, he underwent a 90-minute operation in which cables and screws were used to wire the broken bone back together. He was released from the <ORGANIZATION>St. John's Health Center</ORGANIZATION> on December 30, 2006. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> did not delay his second oath of office on January 5, 2007, although he was still on crutches at the time.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has twice crashed motorcycles on public highways, injuring himself in the process. On January 8, 2006, while riding his <PERSON>Harley Davidson</PERSON> motorcycle in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>, with his son <PERSON>Patrick</PERSON> in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, the governor sustained a minor injury to his lip, forcing him to get 15 stitches. "No citations were issued" said Officer <PERSON>Jason Lee</PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Police Department</ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>, who famously rode motorcycles in the ''Terminator'' movies, has never obtained an M-1 or M-2 endorsement on his <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> driver's license that would allow him to legally ride a motorcycle without a sidecar on the street. Previously, on December 9, 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predict he will require heart valve replacement surgery in the next two to eight years as his current valve degrades. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.

He saved a drowning man's life in 2004 while on vacation in <LOCATION>Hawaii</LOCATION> by swimming out and bringing him back to shore.

<PERSON>Arnold Schwarzenegger</PERSON> has also had a highly successful business career. Following his move to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> became a "prolific goal setter" and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car and succeed in doing so. By the age of 30, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was a millionaire, well before his career in <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION>. His financial independence came from a series of successful business ventures and investments. In 1968, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> and fellow bodybuilder <PERSON>Franco Columbu</PERSON> started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following a major <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> earthquake in 1971. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Columbu</PERSON> used profits from their bricklaying venture to start a mail order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> rolled profits from the mail order business and his bodybuilding competition winnings into his first real estate venture: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000. He would go on to invest in a number of real estate holding companies. In 1992, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> and his wife opened a restaurant in <LOCATION>Santa Monica</LOCATION> called Schatzi On Main. <PERSON>Schatzi</PERSON> literally means "little treasure," colloquial for "honey" or "darling" in German. In 1998, he sold his restaurant. He invested in a shopping mall in <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION>. He has talked about some of those who have helped him over the years in business: "I couldn't have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from <PERSON>Milton Friedman</PERSON> to <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON>... and now, <PERSON>Les Wexner</PERSON> and <PERSON>Warren Buffett</PERSON>. I even learned a thing or two from Planet Hollywood, such as when to get out! And I did!" He has significant ownership in Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment firm.

<PERSON>Arnold Schwarzenegger</PERSON> was a founding celebrity investor in the Planet Hollywood chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe) along with <PERSON>Bruce Willis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sylvester Stallone</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Demi Moore</PERSON>. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> severed his financial ties with the business in early 2000. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> said the company had not had the success he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on "new <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> global business ventures" and his movie career.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON>'s net worth has been conservatively estimated at $100 $200 million. Over the years, he invested his bodybuilding and movie earnings in an array of stocks, bonds, privately controlled companies, and real estate holdings in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and worldwide, so his fortune is sometimes estimated as high as $800 million. In June 1997, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> spent $38 million of his own money on a private Gulfstream Jet. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> once said of his fortune, "Money doesn't make you happy. I now have $50 million, but I was just as happy when I had $48 million." "I've made many millions as a businessman many times over."

During his initial campaign for governor, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> (dubbed Gropegate). Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times recounting allegations of sexual misconduct from several individual women, six of whom eventually came forward with their personal stories.

Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts, a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock. A fifth woman claimed <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last says he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a particular sex act.

<PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> admitted that he has "behaved badly sometimes" and apologized, but also stated that "a lot of (what) you see in the stories is not true." This came after an interview in adult magazine Oui from 1977 surfaced, in which <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances like marijuana. <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. <PERSON>Olympia</PERSON> in the 1975 documentary film Pumping Iron. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION>GQ magazine</ORGANIZATION> in October 2007, <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> said, "[Marijuana] is not a drug. It's a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me." His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.

British television personality <PERSON>Anna Richardson</PERSON> settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> and two of his top aides, <PERSON>Sean Walsh</PERSON> and publicist <PERSON>Sheryl Main</PERSON>. A joint statement read: "The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled." <PERSON>Richardson</PERSON> claimed they tried to tarnish her reputation by dismissing her allegations that <PERSON>Schwarzenegger</PERSON> touched her breast during a press event (for The Sixth Day) in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>. She claimed <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> and Main libeled her in a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> Times article when they contended she encouraged his behavior.











<TITLE><PERSON>Bill Oddie</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>William Edgar Oddie</PERSON>, OBE (born 7 July 1941) is an English actor, writer, comedian, natural history presenter and musician. He became famous as one of the The Goodies.

A birdwatcher since his childhood in <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Oddie</PERSON> has now established a reputation for himself as an ornithologist, conservationist and television presenter on wildlife issues. Some of his books are illustrated with his own paintings and drawings.

<PERSON>Oddie</PERSON>'s wildlife programmes for the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> include: <LOCATION>Springwatch</LOCATION> / Autumnwatch, How to Watch Wildlife, Wild In Your Garden, Birding with <PERSON>Bill Oddie</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> Goes Wild with <PERSON>Bill Oddie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bill Oddie</PERSON> Goes Wild.

After attending <ORGANIZATION>Halesowen Grammar School</ORGANIZATION> (now The <ORGANIZATION>Earls High School</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Halesowen</PERSON>) then King <PERSON>Edward</PERSON>'s School, <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Oddie</PERSON> studied English Literature at <ORGANIZATION>Pembroke College</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Cambridge</ORGANIZATION>, where he appeared in several <ORGANIZATION>Cambridge University Footlights Club</ORGANIZATION> productions. One of these, a revue called A Clump of Plinths, was so successful during its run at the <ORGANIZATION>Edinburgh Fringe Festival</ORGANIZATION> that it was renamed <LOCATION>Cambridge Circus</LOCATION> and transferred to the <LOCATION>West End</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, then <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> and Broadway in September 1964. Meanwhile, still at <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Oddie</PERSON> wrote scripts for TV's That Was The Week That Was. 

His first television appearance was in <PERSON>Bernard Braden</PERSON>'s On The Braden Beat in 1964. Subsequently, he was a key member of the performers in the cult <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> radio series I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again (<LOCATION>ISIRTA</LOCATION>; 1965), where many of his musical compositions were featured. Some were released on the album Distinctly <PERSON>Oddie</PERSON> (Polydor, 1967). He was possibly one of the first performers to parody a rock song, arranging the traditional <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> folk song "On Ilkla Moor Baht'at" in the style of <PERSON>Joe Cocker</PERSON>'s hit rendition of the Beatles' "With a Little Help from My Friends" (released on <PERSON>John Peel</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Dandelion Records</ORGANIZATION> in 1970 and featured in Peel's special box of most-treasured singles), and singing "<PERSON>Andy Pandy</PERSON>" in the style of a brassy soul number such as <PERSON>Wilson Pickett</PERSON> or <PERSON>Geno Washington</PERSON> might perform. In many shows he would do short impressions of Hughie Green. 

In one song on I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again, <PERSON>Oddie</PERSON> performed "What a Wonderful World" with a voice fully reminiscent of <PERSON>Louis Armstrong</PERSON>. During the course of the song, the rest of the cast attributed the gravelly quality of his voice to a sore throat. In the background, during the rest of the song, it is possible to hear the cast dispense cough medicine, then call for a doctor, the arrival of the doctor and his decision that <PERSON>Oddie</PERSON> should go into hospital, the trip to hospital in an ambulance, and the operation extracting his tonsils.

In "serious" ornithological writing, <PERSON>Oddie</PERSON>'s name is usually given formally, as "<PERSON>W. E. Oddie</PERSON>".

<PERSON>Oddie</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>Rochdale</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> on 7 July 1941 to <PERSON>Lilian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>, who also had a daughter, <PERSON>Margaret Jean Oddie</PERSON>, but she died when 5 days old on 21 January 1940. <PERSON>Oddie</PERSON> lived at <ORGANIZATION>Oak Tree Crescent</ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON>Quinton</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> from about age 6 to 15, brought up by his father, <PERSON>Harry</PERSON>, and his father's mother, <PERSON>Emily</PERSON>. <PERSON>Oddie</PERSON> has no memory of his mother, <PERSON>Lilian</PERSON>, living at home.

<TITLE><PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON></TITLE>

<PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON> () (7 November 1913 4 January 1960) was an Algerian-born French author, philosopher, and journalist who won the Nobel prize in 1957. He is often associated with existentialism, but <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> refused this label. On the other hand, as he wrote in his essay The Rebel, his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of nihilism. On the subject of his belief or not in God, he writes in the third volume of his notebooks: "I do not believe in God and I am not an atheist."

In 1949, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> founded the Group for <ORGANIZATION>International Liaisons</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary Union Movement</ORGANIZATION>, according to the book <PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON>, une vie by <PERSON>Olivier Todd</PERSON>, a group opposed to the atheist and communistic tendencies of the surrealistic movement of <LOCATION>Andr Breton</LOCATION>. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> was the second-youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature (after <ORGANIZATION>Rudyard Kipling</ORGANIZATION>) when he became the first African-born writer to receive the award, in 1957. He is also the shortest-lived of any literature laureate to date, having died in an automobile accident only three years after receiving the award.

<PERSON>Camus</PERSON> preferred to be known as a man and a thinker, rather than as a member of a school or ideology. He preferred persons over ideas. In an interview in 1945, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> rejected any ideological associations: "No, I am not an existentialist. <PERSON>Sartre</PERSON> and I are always surprised to see our names linked"

<PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON> was born on 7 November 1913 in <LOCATION>Mondovi</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> to a French-Algerian (pied-noir) settler family. His mother was of Spanish extraction and was half-deaf. His father, <PERSON>Lucien</PERSON>, died in the Battle of the Marne in 1914 during the First World War, while serving as a member of the Zouave infantry regiment. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> lived in poor conditions during his childhood in the <LOCATION>Belcourt</LOCATION> section of <LOCATION>Algiers</LOCATION>. In 1923, he was accepted into the lyce and eventually to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Algiers</ORGANIZATION>. However, he contracted tuberculosis in 1930, which put an end to his football activities (he had been a goalkeeper for the university team) and forced him to make his studies a part-time pursuit. He took odd jobs including private tutor, car parts clerk and work for the <ORGANIZATION>Meteorological Institute</ORGANIZATION>. He completed his licence de philosophie (<ORGANIZATION>BA</ORGANIZATION>) in 1935; in May 1936, he successfully presented his thesis on Plotinus, No-Platonisme et <PERSON>Pense Chrtienne</PERSON>, for his diplme d'tudes suprieures (roughly equivalent to an M.A. by thesis). 

<PERSON>Camus</PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION>French Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> in the Spring of 1935 seeing it as a way to "fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION>", he did not suggest he was a Marxist or that he had read <PERSON>Das Kapital</PERSON>, but did write that "[w]e might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities". In 1936, the independence-minded Algerian <ORGANIZATION>Communist Party</ORGANIZATION> (PCA) was founded. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> joined the activities of the Algerian <ORGANIZATION>People's Party</ORGANIZATION> (<ORGANIZATION>Le Parti du Peuple Algrien</ORGANIZATION>), which got him into trouble with his Communist party comrades. As a result, he was denounced as a Trotskyite and expelled from the party in 1937. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> went on to be associated with the French anarchist movement. The anarchist <PERSON>Andre Prudhommeaux</PERSON> first introduced him at a meeting in 1948 of the Cercle des Etudiants Anarchistes (Anarchist Student Circle) as a sympathiser who was familiar with anarchist thought. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> went on to write for anarchist publications such as <ORGANIZATION>Le Libertaire</ORGANIZATION>, La rvolution Proletarienne and <PERSON>Solidaridad Obrera</PERSON> (the organ of the anarcho-syndicalist CNT). <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> also stood with the anarchists when they expressed support for the uprising of 1953 in <LOCATION>East Germany</LOCATION>. He again stood with the anarchists in 1956, first with the workers uprising in <LOCATION>Poznan</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>, and then later in the year with the Hungarian Revolution. 

In 1934, he married <PERSON>Simone Hie</PERSON>, a morphine addict, but the marriage ended as a consequence of infidelities on both sides. In 1935, he founded Thtre du Travail "Worker's Theatre" (renamed Thtre de l'Equipe ("Team's Theatre") in 1937), which survived until 1939. From 1937 to 1939 he wrote for a socialist paper, <PERSON>Alger-Rpublicain</PERSON>, and his work included an account of the peasants who lived in <LOCATION>Kabylie</LOCATION> in poor conditions, which apparently cost him his job. From 1939 to 1940, he briefly wrote for a similar paper, Soir-Republicain. He was rejected by the French army because of his tuberculosis.

In 1940, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> married <PERSON>Francine Faure</PERSON>, a pianist and mathematician. Although he loved <PERSON>Francine</PERSON>, he had argued passionately against the institution of marriage, dismissing it as unnatural. Even after <PERSON>Francine</PERSON> gave birth to twins, <PERSON>Catherine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jean</PERSON>, on 5 September 1945, he continued to joke wearily to friends that he was not cut out for marriage. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> conducted numerous affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress <PERSON>Maria Casares</PERSON>. In the same year <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> began to work for <ORGANIZATION>Paris-Soir</ORGANIZATION> magazine. In the first stage of World War II, the so-called Phony War stage, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> was a pacifist. However, he was in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> to witness how the Wehrmacht took over. On 15 December 1941, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> witnessed the execution of <PERSON>Gabriel Pri</PERSON>, an event that <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> later said crystallized his revolt against the Germans. Afterwards he moved to <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> alongside the rest of the staff of Paris-Soir. In the same year he finished his first books, The Stranger and The Myth of Sisyphus. He returned briefly to <LOCATION>Oran</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> in 1942.

During the war <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION>, and in it <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> assumed the nom de guerre "Beauchard". <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> became the paper's editor in 1943, and when the Allies liberated <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> reported on the last of the fighting. He was, however, one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition to the use of the atomic bomb in <LOCATION>Hiroshima</LOCATION> soon after the event on 8 August 1945. He eventually resigned from Combat in 1947, when it became a commercial paper. It was then that <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> became acquainted with <PERSON>Jean-Paul Sartre</PERSON>.

After the war, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> began frequenting the <ORGANIZATION>Caf de Flore</ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION>Boulevard Saint-Germain</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Sartre</PERSON> and others. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> also toured the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to lecture about French thinking. Although he leaned left politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually also alienated <PERSON>Sartre</PERSON>. 

In 1949 his tuberculosis returned and he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951 he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which made clear his rejection of communism. The book upset many of his colleagues and contemporaries in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and led to the final split with <PERSON>Sartre</PERSON>. The dour reception depressed him and he began instead to translate plays.

<PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd, the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he explained in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite the split from his "study partner," <PERSON>Sartre</PERSON>, some still argue that <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> falls into the existentialist camp. However, he rejected that label himself in his essay Enigma and elsewhere (see: The Lyrical and Critical Essays of <PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON>). The current confusion may still arise as many recent applications of existentialism have much in common with many of <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' practical ideas (see: Resistance, Rebellion, and Death). However, the personal understanding he had of the world (e.g. "a benign indifference", in The Stranger), and every vision he had for its progress (i.e. vanquishing the "adolescent furies" of history and society, in The Rebel) undoubtedly sets him apart.

In the 1950s <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> devoted his efforts to human rights. In 1952 he resigned from his work for <ORGANIZATION>UNESCO</ORGANIZATION> when the <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> accepted <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> as a member under the leadership of General <PERSON>Franco</PERSON>. In 1953 he criticized Soviet methods to crush a workers' strike in <LOCATION>East Berlin</LOCATION>. In 1956 he protested against similar methods in <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> (protests in <LOCATION>Pozna</LOCATION>) and the Soviet repression of the Hungarian revolution in October. 



He maintained his pacifism and resistance to capital punishment anywhere in the world. One of his most significant contributions to the movement against capital punishment was an essay collaboration with <PERSON>Arthur Koestler</PERSON>, the writer, intellectual and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment.



When the Algerian War began in 1954 it presented a moral dilemma for <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>. He identified with pied-noirs, and defended the French government on the grounds that the revolt in <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> was really an integral part of the 'new Arab imperialism' led by <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> to 'encircle <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>' and 'isolate the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION>'. Although favouring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the pied-noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. 

From 1955 to 1956 <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> wrote for <ORGANIZATION>L'Express</ORGANIZATION>. In 1957 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature "for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times.", officially not for his novel The Fall, published the previous year, but for his writings against capital punishment in the essay Rflexions sur la Guillotine. When he spoke to students at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Stockholm</ORGANIZATION>, he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question and stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION>. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals.

In 1949 <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> founded the Group for <ORGANIZATION>International Liaisons</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary Union Movement</ORGANIZATION>. With <PERSON>George Orwell</PERSON>, he opposed totalitarian regimes in the East and the West.

As he wrote in L'Homme rvolt (in the chapter about "The Thought on Midday") he was a follower of the ancient Greek 'Solar Tradition' (la pense solaire). So, not only he was the leader of the French resistance movement "Combat" but he also set up in 1947-8 the <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary Union Movement</ORGANIZATION> (Groupes de liaison internationale - GLI) which was formed in 1949 and can be described as a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism (Syndicalisme rvolutionnaire). For more, see the book : <PERSON>Alfred Rosmer</PERSON> et le mouvement rvolutionnaire internationale by Christian Gras).

His colleagues were <PERSON>Nicolas Lazarvitch</PERSON>, <PERSON>Louis Mercier</PERSON>, <PERSON>Roger Lapeyre</PERSON>, <PERSON>Paul Chauvet</PERSON>, <PERSON>Auguste Largentier</PERSON>, <PERSON>Jean de Bo</PERSON> (see the article: "<PERSON>Nicolas Lazarvitch</PERSON>, Itinraire d'un syndicaliste rvolutionnaire" by <PERSON>Sylvain Boulouque</PERSON> in the review Communisme, n 61, 2000). His main aim was to express the positive side of Surrealism and Existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the nihilism of <LOCATION>Andr Breton</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Jean-Paul Sartre</PERSON>.

In 1944 <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> founded the "French Committee for the <ORGANIZATION>European Federation</ORGANIZATION>" (<ORGANIZATION>Comit Franais</ORGANIZATION> pour la Fderation Europene -CFFE) declaring that <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> "can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy and peace if the nation states become a federation".

From 1943, <PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON> had correspondence with <PERSON>Altiero Spinelli</PERSON> who founded the <ORGANIZATION>European Federalist Movement</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Milan</LOCATION> (see Ventotene Manifesto and the book "Unire l'Europa, superare gli stati", <PERSON>Altiero Spinelli</PERSON> nel Partito d'Azione del <ORGANIZATION>Nord Italia</ORGANIZATION> e in <LOCATION>Francia</LOCATION> dal 1944 al 1945-annexed a letter by <PERSON>Altiero Spinelli</PERSON> to <PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON>).

In 22-25 March 1945, the first conference of the <ORGANIZATION>European Federalist Movement</ORGANIZATION> was organised in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> with the participation of <PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON>, <PERSON>George Orwell</PERSON>, <PERSON>Emmanuel Mounier</PERSON>, <PERSON>Lewis Mumford</PERSON>, <PERSON>Andr Philip</PERSON>, <PERSON>Daniel Mayer</PERSON>, <PERSON>Franois Bondy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Altiero Spinelli</PERSON> (see the book "The Biography of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>" by Pan Drakopoulos). This specific branch of the <ORGANIZATION>European Federalist Movement</ORGANIZATION> disintegrated in 1957 after the domination of <PERSON>Winston Churchill</PERSON>'s ideas about the European integration.

Three essays by Dr. <PERSON>Miho Takashima</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>International Journal of Humanities</ORGANIZATION> ("Revolt and Equilibrium: A Comparative Study of Nineteen Eighty-Four and L'Homme Rvolt, the Views and Struggles of <PERSON>Orwell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>", "Art and Representation: A Comparative Study of <PERSON>George Orwell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON> on their Literary Works", and "<PERSON>George Orwell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON>: A Comparative Study Their Views and Dilemmas in the Politics of the 1930s and 40s") explore the relation between the work of the French writer <PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON> and the English writer <PERSON>George Orwell</PERSON>.

<PERSON>Takashima</PERSON> argues that Orwellperhaps intentionally, in order to warn the intellectual elitecompromised with "Big Brother", while <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> confronted with The Plague. This is observed not only in the comparison between Nineteen Eighty-Four and The Rebel but, especially, in <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' play The State of Siege. This theatrical play was written together with the novel The Plague and the essay The Rebel. It is the work whichaccording to <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> himselfrepresents him best and is a response to <PERSON>George Orwell</PERSON>'s Nineteen Eighty-Four. The hero, <PERSON>Diego</PERSON>, opposes the totalitarian dictator named Plague, and dies in order to set a Spanish town free from the Inquisition.

The State of Siege is a work against totalitarianism, written in the same epoch when <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' idol, <PERSON>George Orwell</PERSON>, wrote Nineteen Eighty-Four. The play includes an allegorical reference to the end of <PERSON>Orwell</PERSON>'s novel.

The original title of The State of Siege was The Holy Inquisition in <LOCATION>Cadix</LOCATION>. In the French edition of the book, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> has included an essay under the title "Why <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>?". In this polemical text, he answers his <ORGANIZATION>Catholic</ORGANIZATION> friend <PERSON>Gabriel Marcel</PERSON> who criticized him for setting the plot in <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>. Here <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> expresses his opposition to the totalitarian regimes of the West, and to the behavior of the <LOCATION>Vatican</LOCATION> and the Pope during World War II. The most important phrase of this essay is "Why <LOCATION>Guernica</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Gabriel Marcel</PERSON>?".

<PERSON>Camus</PERSON> died on 4 January 1960 in an automobile accident near <LOCATION>Sens</LOCATION>, in a place named "Le Grand Fossard" in the small town of <LOCATION>Villeblevin</LOCATION>. In his coat pocket lay an unused train ticket. It is possible that he had planned to travel by train, but decided to go by car instead.The driver of the Facel Vega car, <PERSON>Michel Gallimard</PERSON> his publisher and close friend also perished in the accident. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> was interred in the <LOCATION>Lourmarin Cemetery</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Lourmarin</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Vaucluse</LOCATION>, Provence-Alpes-Cte d'Azur, <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>. 

He was survived by his twin children, <PERSON>Catherine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jean</PERSON>, who hold the copyrights to his work.

After his death, two of <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' works were published posthumously. The first, entitled A Happy Death published in 1970, featured a character named <LOCATION>Meursault</LOCATION>, as in The Stranger, but there is some debate as to the relationship between the two stories. The second posthumous publication was an unfinished novel, The First Man, that <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> was writing before he died. The novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> and was published in 1995.

Many writers have written on the Absurd, each with his or her own interpretation of what the Absurd actually is and their own ideas on the importance of the Absurd. For example, <PERSON>Sartre</PERSON> recognizes the absurdity of individual experience, while <PERSON>Kierkegaard</PERSON> explains that the absurdity of certain religious truths prevent us from reaching God rationally. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> was not the originator of Absurdism and regretted the continued reference to him as a philosopher of the absurd. He shows less and less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus''). To distinguish <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' ideas of the Absurd from those of other philosophers, people sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' Absurd.

His early thoughts on the Absurd appeared in his first collection of essays, L'Envers et l'endroit (The Two Sides Of The Coin) in 1937. Absurd themes appeared with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, Noces (Nuptials), in 1938. In these essays <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> does not offer a philosophical account of the Absurd, or even a definition; rather he reflects on the experience of the Absurd. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an Absurd life as ''L'tranger'' (''The Stranger''), and in the same year released ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus''), a literary essay on the Absurd. He had also written a play about a Roman Emperor, Caligula, pursuing an Absurd logic. However, the play was not performed until 1945. The turning point in <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the Revue Libre in 1943, the second in the Cahiers de Libration in 1944, and the third in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION>Liberts</ORGANIZATION>, in 1945. All four letters have been published as Lettres un ami allemand (Letters to a German Friend) in 1945, and have appeared in the collection Resistance, Rebellion, and Death.

In his essays <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> presented the reader with dualisms: happiness and sadness, dark and light, life and death, etc. His aim was to emphasize the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality. He did this not to be morbid, but to reflect a greater appreciation for life and happiness. In <PERSON>Le Mythe</PERSON>, this dualism becomes a paradox: We value our lives and existence so greatly, but at the same time we know we will eventually die, and ultimately our endeavours are meaningless. While we can live with a dualism (I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know I will also experience happiness to come), we cannot live with the paradox (I think my life is of great importance, but I also think it is meaningless). In <PERSON>Le Mythe</PERSON>, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> was interested in how we experience the Absurd and how we live with it. Our life must have meaning for us to value it. If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves?

<LOCATION>Meursault</LOCATION>, the Absurdist hero of L'tranger, is a murderer who is executed for his crime. Caligula ends up admitting his Absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about. However, while <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> possibly suggests that <PERSON>Caligula</PERSON>'s Absurd reasoning is wrong, the play's anti-hero does get the last word, as the author similarly exalts <LOCATION>Meursault</LOCATION>'s final moments.

<PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' understanding of the Absurd promotes public debate; his various offerings entice us to think about the Absurd and offer our own contribution. Concepts such as cooperation, joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>. 

<PERSON>Camus</PERSON> made a significant contribution to a viewpoint of the Absurd, and always rejected nihilism as a valid response. "If nothing had any meaning, you would be right. But there is something that still has a meaning." Second Letter to a German Friend, December 1943.

What still had meaning for <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> is that despite humans being subjects in an indifferent and "absurd" universe, in which meaning is challenged by the fact that we all die, meaning can be created, however provisionally and unstably, by our own decisions and interpretations.

Throughout his life, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> spoke out against and actively opposed totalitarianism in its many forms. Early on, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> was active within the French Resistance to the German occupation of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> during World War II, even directing the famous Resistance journal, Combat. On the French collaboration with <ORGANIZATION>Nazi</ORGANIZATION> occupiers he wrote:

<PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' well-known falling out with <PERSON>Sartre</PERSON> is linked to this opposition to totalitarianism. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> detected a reflexive totalitarianism in the mass politics espoused by <PERSON>Sartre</PERSON> in the name of radical Marxism. This was apparent in his work L'Homme Rvolt (The Rebel) which not only was an assault on the Soviet police state, but also questioned the very nature of mass revolutionary politics. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> continued to speak out against the atrocities of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>, a sentiment captured in his 1957 speech, The Blood of the Hungarians, commemorating the anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, an uprising crushed in a bloody assault by the <ORGANIZATION>Red Army</ORGANIZATION>.



In The Stranger, <PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON> characterizes his justification of the absurd through the experiences of a protagonist who simply does not conform to the system. His inherent honesty disturbs the status quo; <LOCATION>Meursault</LOCATION>'s inability to lie cannot seamlessly integrate him within society and in turn threatens the simple fabrics of human mannerisms expected of a structurally ordered society. Consequently, the punishment for his crime is not decided on the basis of murder, but rather for the startling indifference towards his mother's recent death. Even after a conflicting spiritual discussion with a pastor inciting <LOCATION>Meursault</LOCATION> to consider a possible path towards redemption, the latter still refuses to take upon salvation and symbolizes his ultimatum by embracing the "gentle indifference of the world"; an act which only furthers his solidarity with a society incapable of realizing his seemingly inhumane and misanthropic behavior.

The plague is an undeniable part of life. As posited in The Plague, it is omnipresent, just like death was always an impeding factor in The Stranger. <PERSON>Albert Camus</PERSON> once again questions the meaning of the moral concepts justifying humanity and human suffering within a religious framework. For <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>, the rationale behind <ORGANIZATION>Christian</ORGANIZATION> doctrine is useless; as mortal beings, we cannot successfully rationalize the impending and inescapable death sentence forced upon every human. The plague, which befalls upon Oran, is a concrete and tangible facilitator of death. Ultimately, the plague enables people to understand that their individual suffering is meaningless. As the epidemic "evolves" within the seasons, so do the citizens of <LOCATION>Oran</LOCATION>, who instead of willfully giving up to a disease they have no control over, decide to fight against their impending death, thus unwillingly creating optimism in the midst of hopelessness. This is where <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> channels his thoughts behind the importance of solidarity: although the plague is still primarily an agent of death, it provides the uncanny opportunity for people to realize that individual suffering is absurd. In the midst of complete suffering, the challenging response adopted by the majority of the citizens of <LOCATION>Oran</LOCATION> demonstrates an inexplicable humanistic connection between distraught and distant characters. Only by taking the choice to fight an irreversible epidemic are people able to create the ever-lacking meaning to a life destined for execution the moment of its creation.

<PERSON>Camus</PERSON> was once asked by his friend <PERSON>Charles Poncet</PERSON> which he preferred, football or the theatre. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> is said to have replied, "Football, without hesitation."

<PERSON>Camus</PERSON> played as goalkeeper for <ORGANIZATION>Racing Universitaire Algerios</ORGANIZATION> (RUA won both the North African Champions Cup and the North African Cup twice each in the 1930s) junior team from 192830. The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> enormously. In match reports <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> would often attract positive comment for playing with passion and courage. Any aspirations in football disappeared at age 17, upon contracting tuberculosisthen incurable, <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> was bedridden for long and painful periods.

When <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> was asked in the 1950s by an alumni sports magazine for a few words regarding his time with the RUA, his response included the following:

<PERSON>Camus</PERSON> was referring to a sort of simplistic morality he wrote about in his early essays, the principle of sticking up for your friends, of valuing bravery and fair-play. <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' belief was that political and religious authorities try to confuse us with over-complicated moral systems to make things appear more complex than they really are, potentially to serve their own needs.

Several of <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' works have been adapted into movies. The Stranger has been adapted into an Italian 1967 movie by <PERSON>Luchino Visconti</PERSON>, and also to a 2001 Turkish adaptation titled Yazgi (Fate) by <PERSON>Zeki Demirkubuz</PERSON>. The Plague was adapted to a 1992 film titled La Peste by <PERSON>Luis Puenzo</PERSON> and set in modern day <LOCATION>America</LOCATION>.

Quite a few musical artists refer to <PERSON>Camus</PERSON> and his work in their music. The post-punk band The Fall took their name from <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>' novel The Fall. These also include an album by <PERSON>Jeff Martin</PERSON>(Exile and the Kingdom, 2006) and songs by <ORGANIZATION>Gentle Giant</ORGANIZATION> ("A Cry for Everyone", 1972), The Cure ("Killing an Arab", 1978), <PERSON>Tuxedomoon</PERSON> ("The Stranger", 1979), Digable Planets ("Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space)", 1993) The Magnetic Fields ("I Don't Want To Get Over You", 1999), The Manic Street Preachers ("The Masses Against The Classes", 2000), JJ72 ("<LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION>", 2000), Suede ("Obsessions", 2002), Streetlight Manifesto ("Here's To Life", 2003), A Perfect Circle ("A Stranger" and "The Outsider", 2003), <PERSON>Angela McCluskey</PERSON> ("Know it All", 2004), <PERSON>Joanna Newsom</PERSON> ("This Side of the Blue", 2004), <LOCATION>Tarkio</LOCATION> ("Neapolitan Bridesmaid", 2006), The Independence, ("20-Ought-Almost-Talkin' Blues"), 2008.

Anti-folk singer-songwriter <PERSON>Jeffrey Lewis</PERSON> references <PERSON>Camus</PERSON>, as well as <PERSON>Bob Dylan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allen Ginsberg</PERSON>, in a 2005 song, "<ORGANIZATION>Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror</ORGANIZATION>" in the line, "And I'm sure the thing is probably <PERSON>Dylan</PERSON> himself too, stayed up some nights wishing he was as good as <PERSON>Ginsberg</PERSON> or Camus."
